00:00:00  I joined over 11,000 furries in VRChat to experience one of the largest virtual conventions
00:00:06  to ever happen, Ferality.
00:00:08  I'm not a furry, but I am a long-time VR user and enthusiast, so I made it my personal
00:00:14  mission to finally sit down, figure out what's actually going on here, and document what
00:00:19  attending a virtual furry convention is like.
00:00:22  I expect the majority of you watching are not furries and probably haven't been to
00:00:26  anything like this before, and well, there's a lot to unpack here and it's way more interesting
00:00:33  than you might think.
00:00:37  Before we get started, I want to give a huge thanks to this video's sponsor, Ramen VR,
00:00:42  and their game, Zenith the Last City.
00:00:45  Inspired by anime, JRPGs, MMOs, and more, Zenith hit the number one best-selling game on Steam,
00:00:50  Oculus, and PSVR as soon as it launched earlier last year.
00:00:54  Assuming most of you are VR users already, or at least interested in becoming one, Zenith
00:00:59  is a great pickup with a lot to check out.
00:01:62  From dungeons and raids, cooking and crafting, gliding, climbing, pets, and more, there is
00:01:66  definitely something here that will hit everyone's interests.
00:01:69  PSVR2 launched literally this week, so now is the perfect time to grab a copy of the
00:01:74  game and join a huge new influx of users to adventure with.
00:01:78  Their 1.3 patch is also about to come out, which is bringing a whole new class of character
00:01:83  you can choose called Cyber Ninja, and just look at the concept design, I think it's by far the
00:01:88  coolest one yet. Additionally, I'm a massive advocate for full body tracking and how important
00:01:93  having legs in VR is, and they recently added it to their game which puts it leagues above so
00:01:99  many other virtual reality titles out there. So yeah, go check out Zenith the Lost City for
00:01:104  yourself with the link in the description, and go join a guild or something while supporting
00:01:108  VR development. And with that, back to the video. This is Ferality Luma Festival, a halfway mini-fest
00:01:115  between the larger version of the convention that's happening later this year. Although Ferality pulls
00:01:119  in thousands of people for each event, you don't hear a lot about anyone going except for, well,
00:02:124  furries. And to get the elephant out of the room, people hate furries. Well, at least from what it
00:02:131  seems on the internet. They've been an easy target to laugh at, cringe at, and make fun of for a long
00:02:137  time, which isn't necessarily surprising.
00:02:140  I've personally never had any problem with furries.
00:02:142  I generally like to hold the belief that people should express themselves however they want,
00:02:146  but I also never really interacted with them until playing VR.
00:02:150  And the amount of furries in VRChat is a crazy phenomena.
00:02:155  There are so many.
00:02:158  Practically every world you go to, there will be at least one person in some sort of furry
00:02:162  avatar.
00:02:163  But why?
00:02:164  Furries and VR chat feel like a match made in heaven.
00:02:169  We're the authors, we're the game designers, we are the architects of our own realities.
00:02:174  I can be who I want to be, whenever I want to be.
00:02:178  Over and over again, I've talked on this channel about how one of the craziest parts
00:03:182  of VR is the raw expression you can have when embodying an avatar.
00:03:186  And while this is appealing to almost everyone for a variety of reasons, it makes perfect
00:03:191  sense when implying to furries.
00:03:193  Think about it, people come up with their characters they identify with, aka their fursonas,
00:03:198  and unlike most cosplays that can be made with relative ease, it's a lot harder to
00:03:203  dress up as an anthropomorphic character.
00:03:205  The infamous fursuit is uncomfortable, sweaty, and extremely costly, in some cases even paying
00:03:211  up to $6,000.
00:03:213  Now compare this to a VR avatar, not only is it significantly less costly, but they're
00:03:219  also way closer to the character you might have designed because there's literally zero physical
00:03:224  limitations from doing what you want. So with that in mind, it makes sense that the community
00:03:229  would have the resources to put together something like a large-scale festival.
00:03:234  I'm Dalton. I'm chairman and creative director of Ferality. I found the furry fandom through VRChat.
00:04:241  I only had a chance to attend a few physical events prior to the pandemic. Within the VR
00:04:246  furry community, we knew where we were while we saw the overall furry fandom really having a sense
00:04:255  of loss. There were sort of murmurs in the community of, well, wouldn't it be great if we could
00:04:260  just attend a convention right here in VRChat? The first Ferality was in 2020 with the founder
00:04:267  Dalton hoping to pull in a few hundred people at best, but over 2,600 furries came through.
00:04:274  Of course, things kept expanding, and now there's been a total of five full-ferality conventions,
00:04:279  along with this past weekend's Luma Festival marking a halfway point before this year's
00:04:283  sixth event in June, with the most previous convention bringing in over 15,000 registered
00:04:290  attendees. I never went to any of these events, so with this one being my first, I decided to go
00:04:295  into full immersion mode and do the absolute unthinkable make my own furry avatar. My online
00:05:302  username everywhere is Fia Bunny and so obviously I had to pick up bunny and so voila!
00:05:316  This was 30 hours straight of live music, dancing, and meetups. Despite being a mini event,
00:05:322  it was jam-packed full of non-stop energy. On my agenda was just a few things. Attend the
00:05:328  the opening ceremonies, go to the rabbit road at meetup,
00:05:331  check out the avatar dealer's den,
00:05:333  and watch the fireworks before the closing ceremonies
00:05:335  the next night.
00:05:336  Multiple events run all at once,
00:05:338  with dozens of individual instances
00:05:341  to hold the thousands of concurrent attendees
00:05:343  spread across all the worlds.
00:05:345  Off the bat, the hype levels were off the charts,
00:05:347  with the hosts displaying across the worlds as holograms.
00:05:350  There were zero negative interactions and zero trolls,
00:05:353  which was weird because as I'm sure you know,
00:05:356  VRChat is usually full of that.
00:05:358  Meetups happened for almost every subculture
00:06:361  and checking meeting out the other furry bunnies
00:06:363  running around was a really funny experience.
00:06:366  Everyone had some really interesting and unique avatars
00:06:369  and so when I headed over to the dealer's den,
00:06:372  I got to check out some of the ones
00:06:373  that you could actually buy.
00:06:374  At the full Ferality conventions,
00:06:376  things are way more fleshed out with panels and clubs,
00:06:379  but even just this, well, there was so much going on,
00:06:383  was almost overwhelming trying to not miss anything.
00:06:386  But the weirdest thing I saw was on the online site.
00:06:388  They had a web store where you could buy something
00:06:391  called immersion spray.
00:06:392  And obviously I had to cop it immediately.
00:06:395  Unfortunately though, it didn't end up coming in on time
00:06:398  despite me paying $20 for the fastest shipping,
00:06:401  which I actually have still yet to receive.
00:06:403  I don't even know, but I can't test it, so sorry guys.
00:06:406  But this is really interesting for a couple of reasons.
00:06:408  So let me elaborate a bit on why.
00:06:411  Your brain's smell system is the olfactory bulb,
00:06:414  and the olfactory bulb is directly connected
00:06:416  to your amygdala and hippocampus,
00:06:419  the hotspots for your emotions and memories.
00:07:422  This is why if you smell a certain scent,
00:07:424  you immediately get transported to the memories
00:07:426  and feelings tied to that certain place or person.
00:07:430  I have tried VR smell devices before,
00:07:432  but those have always been focused on stuff
00:07:434  like picking up coffee and triggering the smell of coffee
00:07:436  to be pumped into your nose.
00:07:438  This immersion spray, on the other hand,
00:07:440  is something I've never seen before,
00:07:442  which is to give Luma Festival a specific sense of place,
00:07:446  similar to the smell of a friend's house
00:07:448  or Spaceship Earth at Disney World,
00:07:449  if you know you know on that one.
00:07:451  What if we made the play space smell
00:07:455  like an enchanted forest?
00:07:456  It smells a little earthy, a little ethereal,
00:07:460  a little bit sweet.
00:07:461  For the longest time, the jacket that I was wearing
00:07:464  while we were doing Luma still had the scent on it,
00:07:468  and whenever I was driving to go to FWA,
00:07:471  I still had this smell on my jacket, I'm like...
00:07:476  The worlds in theming are clearly
00:07:478  a really important aspect of these conventions,
00:08:480  and they're unlike places I've ever seen
00:08:482  in video games, movies, anime, or anything else.
00:08:485  I love exploring VRChat worlds that people upload.
00:08:488  I think there's something really special
00:08:490  about exploring places from other people's imaginations.
00:08:493  Seeing the concepts and time and energy
00:08:496  that goes into this really struck me in a way I didn't expect from going to a furry con.
00:08:501  After thinking for a bit, I got really shocked to think of how judgmental we are from the outside looking in on this.
00:08:507  I feel like the misconception comes from the issue of like the squeaky wheel gets the attention.
00:08:513  It's unfortunate that people just associate furries with, oh, they like f***ing animals or something like that, pardon the French.
00:08:521  Furry culture in general is quite misunderstood.
00:08:524  prior media that has misconstrued what furry culture is like.
00:08:528  I don't blame them, it gets clicks.
00:08:530  I mean, you see how Twitter is these days with anything, causes drama,
00:08:533  everybody goes insane about it.
00:08:534  And it's just that furries and their drama have stuck around a lot
00:08:537  because a lot of the subcultures within furry communities are neurodivergent,
00:09:544  which means there's a lot of social immaturity at times.
00:09:547  And that tends towards lending towards drama.
00:09:551  but there are also the most mature, friendly, insanely loving individuals
00:09:558  I have never felt love in my life before, like I have in the furry community.
00:09:563  Honestly, after all of this, my perception on furries has really changed.
00:09:567  What once seemed a bit silly now feels like a whole fun new world to be uncovered.
00:09:572  You can really tell how passionate they are about creating unique characters and worlds,
00:09:577  the kind of imagination and creativity that shines best inside virtual reality.
00:09:582  I didn't expect to enjoy being one myself for a little while, but the respect I have for this
00:09:586  community has grown by a lot. I think they might just be the most progressive designers, developers,
00:09:592  and creatives virtual reality has to offer right now, and that's something that I think is truly
00:09:598  spectacular. If you're interested in checking out Ferality for yourself, the next convention is going
00:10:603  to be a tropical jungle theme on June 2nd through 4th. I'm linking their socials down below so you
00:10:608  can stay up to date and give it a chance just like I did. Please like and subscribe to support as I
00:10:613  have a bunch of new videos in the works about other unique aspects of VR culture and technology,
00:10:619  and of course our monthly TBR studio live events. But anyway, thanks so much for watching. I've been
00:10:625  your host Fia and I'll see you in the next video. Bye!
