02:01.702 --> 02:05.227
Hello! Test desk! Can you guys hear me?

02:15.261 --> 02:20.278
Sorry, I'm clearing my throat. Anyways, hello! Good morning!

02:21.664 --> 02:23.114
Good morning! Yes, good morning!

02:24.262 --> 02:25.228
What's up?

02:28.466 --> 02:32.000
We're gonna play some of this really cool nice relaxing game

02:33.123 --> 02:39.000
Since it's so early in the morning you just wanna wake up and go back to sleep right?

02:39.261 --> 02:43.859
So this is like a nice chill rhythm game

02:44.201 --> 02:49.619
I think I've seen a little bit of it so I'm curious to try it out

02:50.101 --> 02:53.618
Let's see let's see

02:54.101 --> 02:55.935
Let's see, you're watching while you're at work.

02:56.660 --> 02:58.337
I hope you're focusing.

02:59.860 --> 03:02.277
Or else you might get in trouble.

03:03.741 --> 03:04.395
Not for me though.

03:05.580 --> 03:06.492
I give you the A-OK.

03:11.240 --> 03:12.075
Focus watching.

03:13.561 --> 03:14.434
Yeah, yeah.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.857
It's here in Japan.

03:18.120 --> 03:18.965
It is now 9.30 PM.

03:21.620 --> 03:22.886
I woke up today at 1pm so...

03:26.740 --> 03:31.479
I just laid in bed for a bit, had some breakfast...

03:32.765 --> 03:36.118
And I did some small recordings that I need to finish.

03:37.246 --> 03:37.529
Sort of.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.635
Direct traffic that you're watching. Yeah, yeah. Very funny.

03:48.768 --> 03:53.680
I downloaded a new mobile game. I was playing some stupid game the farming game

03:57.003 --> 03:57.448
Yes 9 30 p.m.

04:00.463 --> 04:04.620
9 30 p.m. I haven't left. I haven't been outside all day today

04:05.862 --> 04:07.075
stocked up on snacks

04:07.740 --> 04:09.094
yesterday last night

04:10.002 --> 04:11.880
after some dance stuff

04:13.024 --> 04:14.720
Now we have a break for a little while

04:15.866 --> 04:17.996
And you gotta do a refresher and then...

04:18.921 --> 04:24.419
Who knows where you guys might see some of our very cool dance lessons pay off, huh?

04:25.323 --> 04:27.795
Where might you guys see that?

04:28.740 --> 04:32.696
Honestly, it's super fun to learn like, um, dances as a group.

04:34.346 --> 04:35.094
That's really cool.

04:36.042 --> 04:38.916
Fest? It might be a little sooner than that.

04:40.003 --> 04:41.033
Oh my god!

04:41.821 --> 04:43.877
Alright, new game! Let's play!

04:44.300 --> 04:44.851
Fuck, fuck.

04:45.961 --> 04:46.874
My space bar.

04:49.981 --> 04:50.955
How's dancing practice?

04:51.401 --> 04:53.199
Well, you guys know already, you know.

04:53.401 --> 04:54.454
I'm pretty good at dancing.

04:57.720 --> 04:58.590
But you know, we had our...

05:00.104 --> 05:00.532
Sensei.

05:01.061 --> 05:02.455
She was very good at teaching us.

05:03.423 --> 05:03.669
So...

05:04.644 --> 05:04.830
Yeah.

05:06.741 --> 05:07.299
Okay, what does it say?

05:07.340 --> 05:09.898
Please beware that this game contains visual effects flashing lights.

05:10.504 --> 05:11.198
Okay, proceed.

05:11.502 --> 05:12.674
You guys hear that? Be aware.

05:14.502 --> 05:15.431
Be aware.

05:17.542 --> 05:19.239
Yeah, I got some skankin' in.

05:19.687 --> 05:20.055
Mm-hmm.

05:20.583 --> 05:22.280
Melts on the rhythm game requires precise timing.

05:22.401 --> 05:25.300
For a dreamy experience, make sure your sound is on and avoid using Bluetooth audio.

05:25.865 --> 05:27.078
Let's start by testing your inputs.

05:27.320 --> 05:31.718
Follow the rhythm and hit space on the beat when moving circles fully overlap with center circle.

05:33.128 --> 05:34.037
Uhh... I'll like... Okay.

05:43.804 --> 05:44.654
Oh... Oh...

05:45.723 --> 05:46.816
Eh... Eh...

05:51.485 --> 05:52.175
Okay...

05:53.601 --> 05:56.958
That's probably right. That's fine. I'm using my keyboard, so...

05:58.423 --> 06:03.618
There should not be much delay except for my... the ping in my brain.

06:05.146 --> 06:06.817
Let's run through the rest of the tutorial.

06:08.103 --> 06:12.320
Melatonin is all about recognizing audio-visual cues and reacting to them at the right time according to the rhythm.

06:13.263 --> 06:18.260
For the first lesson, pay attention to the cues. They will be hinting for you to react on the fourth beat when the circles fully overlap.

06:19.956 --> 06:20.098
Ehh?

06:23.340 --> 06:24.997
Ehh! Look, early!

06:27.810 --> 06:27.912
Ehh!

06:29.024 --> 06:32.179
Every level in the game will eventually expect you to follow the cues without the visual guide.

06:32.320 --> 06:36.099
There will be less guidance for the next lesson, but try to react on the fourth beat like last time.

06:45.053 --> 06:48.759
Okay, I was late twice, but I'm always late, so...

06:49.826 --> 06:50.635
You know, it's fine.

06:51.563 --> 06:53.073
A tempo game, yeah yeah.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.227
This game is pretty recent.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.935
You can get it now on Steam, not as long as it's stream, just letting you guys know.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.798
The levels will have multiple reaction types.

07:02.960 --> 07:07.340
In the next lesson, follow the cues and react with left and right keys on the second and

07:07.401 --> 07:07.807
fourth beat.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.473
Left and right or like WASD?

07:13.727 --> 07:13.848
Umm...

07:16.611 --> 07:17.518
Okay, not WASD.

07:17.860 --> 07:18.227
Got it.

07:19.248 --> 07:19.676
Okay.

07:19.901 --> 07:20.574
Okay.

07:22.687 --> 07:25.799
There will also be times when you need to start and end your reaction at different times.

07:26.060 --> 07:29.338
In this final lesson, hold space on the third beat and let go on the fourth.

07:29.781 --> 07:30.209
Oh, sorry.

07:31.811 --> 07:32.619
I wasn't paying attention.

07:36.736 --> 07:37.379
I let go late.

07:38.847 --> 07:39.893
Man, I'm stuck already!

07:40.940 --> 07:43.700
Every level in the game will have a unique set of audio and visual cues for you to learn

07:43.782 --> 07:44.169
and follow.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.260
There is a practice mode for each level that guides you through the proper timing, but

07:47.260 --> 07:49.137
eventually you'll just have to rely on following the cues.

07:49.521 --> 07:52.700
If the game feels too difficult, remember that there are various assist options in the

07:52.760 --> 07:54.814
accessibility settings to fine tune the difficulty.

07:55.945 --> 07:56.067
What?

07:56.700 --> 07:56.863
No.

07:57.782 --> 07:58.231
We got it.

07:59.067 --> 07:59.700
That's the end of the tutorial.

07:59.882 --> 08:00.915
Ready to start the game?

08:01.401 --> 08:01.932
Let's go!

08:02.784 --> 08:03.148
Okay...

08:07.382 --> 08:10.440
There's a story mode! Oh my god, this is what my place looks like right now.

08:12.803 --> 08:15.880
I've been snacking on stuff. It's cuz the trash here is confusing.

08:15.980 --> 08:20.600
It's like, you gotta take off, you gotta do all this stuff, you gotta take off the wrapping from the bottle and...

08:23.184 --> 08:24.558
You gotta separate everything and...

08:27.051 --> 08:29.019
You know, I've got piles, I'm working on it.

08:30.003 --> 08:34.700
Alright, oh yeah, I'm assuming I move with the...

08:35.306 --> 08:36.679
Oh, I can move wherever I want.

08:38.313 --> 08:39.039
I can free roam!

08:40.588 --> 08:42.660
I wanna go back to the real world.

08:43.464 --> 08:46.019
I don't wanna be asleep. I already slept too much today.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.315
Dream about food.

08:48.063 --> 08:49.336
Just kidding, I can always sleep some more.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.518
Okay, dream about shopping, food.

08:52.629 --> 08:53.255
Is this free?

08:54.465 --> 08:56.177
I can go wherever I want? Freedom?

08:57.327 --> 08:58.740
Unlock. I have to unlock this one.

08:58.881 --> 08:59.993
Dream about followers?

09:01.665 --> 09:04.157
Wow. You guys are like my followers, huh?

09:04.821 --> 09:06.356
I could totally just dream about you guys.

09:06.861 --> 09:08.700
That happens sometimes. I dream about chat.

09:09.425 --> 09:11.700
I dream about reading chat, responding to people in chat.

09:17.285 --> 09:18.498
Us? What?

09:19.205 --> 09:19.508
Oh no...

09:20.780 --> 09:24.418
Alright, alright. What do you guys feel like? Food, shopping, tech or followers?

09:25.566 --> 09:27.639
I'll let you pick. Sorry if I freeze, it's cause...

09:29.467 --> 09:30.498
My setup's kind of weird.

09:31.740 --> 09:33.679
That's right, dreaming about you guys.

09:36.102 --> 09:38.619
Is the audio okay in terms of like the balance? Supposed to be pretty loud.

09:38.821 --> 09:40.740
Food! You guys, really? You're hungry?

09:41.903 --> 09:42.067
Okay.

09:43.963 --> 09:46.691
Let's go! Practice! We must practice.

09:50.482 --> 09:53.296
Audio's good. Okay.

09:54.824 --> 09:57.820
This stream has three patterns to react to. Make sure you're familiar with how they sound

09:57.880 --> 10:00.835
before moving on to score mode. The last one is a bit tricky.

10:01.740 --> 10:04.780
Practice mode will guide you through this using timing circle and metronome. If you'd

10:04.820 --> 10:07.755
like to be guided at all times, you can enable it in the existing value settings.

10:09.485 --> 10:10.451
Oh. What am I doing?

10:13.094 --> 10:13.235
Oh

10:20.722 --> 10:21.247
I see itself

10:35.701 --> 10:36.509
Pizza

10:41.315 --> 10:42.500
It is useful having the circle.

10:45.032 --> 10:45.816
Was it early?

10:52.742 --> 10:54.216
Okay, okay.

10:55.021 --> 11:00.228
Oh, what early? Too late. 12 perfect!

11:09.626 --> 11:10.475
Okay, I think I'm ready.

11:12.064 --> 11:15.217
I wonder if there's like a remix at the end that has all of them.

11:18.323 --> 11:19.192
Nice, nice.

11:22.768 --> 11:24.032
This game looks nice, doesn't it?

11:27.465 --> 11:27.626
Oh

11:30.420 --> 11:36.465
Byee hearing me say B

11:58.340 --> 11:59.009
Too early!

12:10.143 --> 12:10.369
Okay

12:18.062 --> 12:18.794
Okay

12:20.243 --> 12:22.188
Donuts!

12:26.601 --> 12:28.244
Okay, okay.

12:35.240 --> 12:36.690
hearing negative Café

12:38.404 --> 12:38.547
Ah!

12:48.050 --> 12:48.172
Ah!

12:59.313 --> 12:59.496
Ah!

13:01.811 --> 13:01.953
Ah!

13:03.287 --> 13:04.857
I got scared!

13:08.522 --> 13:09.169
I gotta go again

13:12.248 --> 13:14.999
Restart. I think I need to get two stars.

13:41.694 --> 13:41.856
Okay.

13:42.902 --> 13:45.369
Okay, okay, I'm getting it!

13:49.361 --> 13:49.704
Ahh!

13:51.522 --> 13:51.644
Ahh!

13:54.331 --> 13:54.411
Ahh!

13:56.209 --> 13:56.351
Ahh!

13:58.553 --> 13:58.694
Ahh!

13:59.745 --> 14:00.331
Ahh!

14:01.543 --> 14:01.825
Ahh!

14:03.341 --> 14:03.482
Ahh!

14:06.007 --> 14:06.290
Ahh!

14:07.563 --> 14:07.684
Ahh!

14:10.331 --> 14:10.573
Ahh!

14:11.360 --> 14:19.252
My keyboard's too sensitive

14:25.441 --> 14:39.313
What a good Look at that impact!

14:55.054 --> 14:57.498
I had the same amount of misses!

14:58.360 --> 15:00.079
It's the lag, it's the lag!

15:01.705 --> 15:06.720
I don't know why it's hard, like in Rhythm Heaven Fever, I think having the cute characters

15:06.821 --> 15:07.669
helps me a lot.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.280
There's still some levels that I struggled pretty bad with when I first played Rhythm

15:12.341 --> 15:12.770
Heaven Fever.

15:13.280 --> 15:13.811
I just gotta pay attention.

15:14.722 --> 15:18.220
I just gotta pay attention. It's like I do better when I can't see it.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.755
It's because of the sound.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.199
I'm so hungry!

15:28.825 --> 15:29.836
Ah, I wasn't paying attention.

15:37.169 --> 15:37.654
One more time.

15:39.303 --> 15:40.105
I'm hungry! Let me eat!

15:48.248 --> 15:52.099
I'll get it. We restart until there's no mistakes.

15:53.662 --> 15:53.882
Okay.

16:05.661 --> 16:08.270
I'll take one.

16:12.906 --> 16:15.877
I entirely played.

16:17.161 --> 16:17.563
Are you okay?

16:22.443 --> 16:22.544
Hey.

16:23.681 --> 16:23.864
Hey.

16:25.884 --> 16:29.218
What's going on?

16:29.821 --> 16:33.818
Are you okay?

17:05.644 --> 17:10.939
That confuses me!

17:11.621 --> 17:13.586
What?! What?!

17:31.017 --> 17:32.779
I did one better than last time.

17:34.270 --> 17:35.058
I did one better

17:39.742 --> 17:44.560
I'll add it on my keyboard. Maybe if I play with my eyes closed. Maybe that'll help

17:50.148 --> 17:57.800
I was looking at chat while playing maybe that'll help

17:59.361 --> 18:00.042
Ah, excuse me.

18:20.260 --> 18:20.500
Huh?

18:44.124 --> 18:44.366
Mmm!

19:02.043 --> 19:02.447
Oh no!

19:05.009 --> 19:06.519
Talking takes too much brain power

19:17.573 --> 19:19.536
That doesn't make any sense to my brain!

19:23.144 --> 19:23.269
Ah

19:28.650 --> 19:28.733
Ah

19:32.588 --> 19:37.879
I did a little bit better.

19:38.380 --> 19:39.812
Look I'm going down one at a time.

19:40.780 --> 19:41.474
One at a time.

19:41.984 --> 19:42.637
I'm getting there.

19:44.865 --> 19:48.954
I'm trying to play with my eyes closed.

19:53.203 --> 19:56.549
I'm trying to play with my eyes closed.

20:02.020 --> 20:02.653
That confused me!

20:03.121 --> 20:04.353
Bum bum bum bum?

20:05.489 --> 20:05.714
Fuck!

20:06.326 --> 20:06.428
Next!

20:07.421 --> 20:12.597
Oh this game is so relaxing though, right?

20:14.185 --> 20:15.134
Haha hehe.

20:20.414 --> 20:21.498
There should be nightmare mode.

20:22.220 --> 20:22.970
Is there nightmare mode?

20:24.442 --> 20:30.915
Where like the aesthetic changes and the pizza's like melting and bloody or something.

20:34.002 --> 20:34.766
Oh, oops.

20:43.396 --> 20:44.539
And the burger's evil.

20:45.868 --> 20:46.939
And instead it eats you.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.255
Nightmare mode! And it's difficult, you know?

21:09.444 --> 21:10.171
I don't get it!

21:14.851 --> 21:16.475
I don't get the one where it scoots closer

21:22.749 --> 21:27.980
No, don't! Go away!

21:32.228 --> 21:37.238
Okay, it said I was too late

21:38.080 --> 21:38.570
Okay, got it.

21:41.782 --> 21:41.925
Okay.

21:50.162 --> 21:50.631
Fakkyo!

21:53.504 --> 21:54.474
This is...a nightmare.

21:56.346 --> 21:56.427
1 to 4?

21:58.761 --> 21:59.492
I don't know how to count.

22:02.541 --> 22:03.274
You guys distracting me?

22:04.268 --> 22:04.877
Not reading chat

22:24.926 --> 22:25.028
Okay

22:25.541 --> 22:26.153
Ah!

22:27.904 --> 22:29.217
Maybe I can afford to miss one.

22:30.969 --> 22:31.173
Or like...

22:31.500 --> 22:32.227
I'm gonna afford to miss one

22:34.126 --> 22:35.439
Or like, two or three.

22:35.765 --> 22:35.888
MMMM.

22:37.021 --> 22:38.742
Ah, I forgot.

22:55.001 --> 23:00.350
I didn't press it.

23:06.486 --> 23:06.652
Ahh!

23:10.581 --> 23:11.351
Bam bam!

23:13.484 --> 23:13.545
Ahh!

23:18.426 --> 23:18.548
Ahh!

23:25.567 --> 23:28.070
I got two stars!

23:37.561 --> 23:41.250
I'm getting better!

23:45.982 --> 23:46.574
I got two stars!

23:48.222 --> 23:48.794
I'm getting better!

23:49.781 --> 23:52.378
Yeah, it's a relaxing game, right? You guys like this song, right?

23:53.041 --> 23:54.900
Don't you guys just really like songs so much, you know?

23:54.940 --> 23:56.136
You just listen to it on repeat.

23:56.642 --> 23:57.817
Again and again and again.

23:59.185 --> 23:59.573
And again.

24:01.273 --> 24:01.758
Okay, last one.

24:24.042 --> 24:24.675
One more, one more.

24:27.671 --> 24:29.077
I can stop anytime, it's true

24:55.461 --> 24:55.582
oh

25:03.220 --> 25:14.048
I always forget when I move the board, I don't know why.

25:30.164 --> 25:32.158
This song sounds so nice, I just get distracted

25:36.125 --> 25:47.579
Give me my fucking donut!

26:01.952 --> 26:10.200
Okay, okay. Look, we got two stars. That's all we need. It said eight stars and there's

26:10.401 --> 26:17.340
four areas. And if you need eight stars, you only need two stars from each area. So, you

26:17.480 --> 26:19.838
You know, that means we did good enough!

26:23.080 --> 26:24.595
Should we go to shopping next?

26:28.080 --> 26:28.733
Quick maths.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.060
Yup, checks out, right? What is this?

26:34.644 --> 26:37.080
In the stream, items will be dropped in specific patterns on the left.

26:37.342 --> 26:40.060
Memorize them and swipe your card in the same pattern on the right.

26:40.624 --> 26:42.456
Oh god, this already sounds complicated.

26:45.242 --> 26:46.696
Wait, am I using the key? Wait.

26:47.423 --> 26:47.827
Space? Oh.

26:51.733 --> 26:52.919
Oh, okay, it's like Simon Says.

26:53.161 --> 26:53.632
Okay, okay.

27:02.185 --> 27:02.288
Ah.

27:02.840 --> 27:09.928
Oops, okay, I see

27:22.791 --> 27:23.456
I was paying attention!

27:30.686 --> 27:31.777
Okay...

27:33.201 --> 27:34.534
This one's easy...

27:36.180 --> 27:38.274
How is this like Among Us? Oh, the swipe?

27:40.623 --> 27:44.120
No! It's not the same, because that one you control with the mouse.

27:44.342 --> 27:44.888
This one you just go...

27:46.140 --> 27:47.413
In this stream, I know some jobs... Wait, did I...

27:48.481 --> 27:51.794
Oops, I meant to do the real thing. Okay

28:00.080 --> 28:04.539
Okay, cute face in the bag

28:08.933 --> 28:11.040
I didn't know it was gonna start until after

28:34.800 --> 28:34.881
oh

28:36.920 --> 28:38.261
How can you do that?

29:02.344 --> 29:02.971
Look!

29:04.060 --> 29:06.483
Okay, okay, okay!

29:30.734 --> 29:32.798
Okay, okay, okay.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.000
I keep thinking it'll go faster.

29:36.222 --> 29:38.318
I didn't know there was gonna be so many items.

29:38.962 --> 29:40.472
We'll do it one more time, right?

29:41.880 --> 29:43.312
You guys want this diamond ring?

29:44.220 --> 29:44.727
I'll buy it.

29:45.800 --> 29:46.204
I'll buy it.

29:48.148 --> 29:48.474
More.

29:48.760 --> 29:48.923
Now hard.

29:50.986 --> 29:52.936
Now hard! Did I unlock it? Cool.

30:20.040 --> 30:23.924
Oops, I waited too long.

30:44.164 --> 30:44.585
Fuck!!

30:49.241 --> 30:49.603
Okay..

30:54.661 --> 30:57.745
Fuck Design Did You Go 3?

31:29.553 --> 31:38.440
Okay, not that bad. Oh, hard mode! Okay. Now my hand cramping from swiping the card too

31:38.500 --> 31:40.379
Damn, I'm rich!

31:41.922 --> 31:47.239
I can buy so much stuff. I thought at first the bag faces were angry if you were late, but I think it's just random, huh?

31:52.167 --> 31:53.460
Okay, wait. I wasn't prepared. I wasn't ready.

31:53.542 --> 31:54.015
I wasn't ready

31:55.161 --> 31:56.255
I'm ready, let's retry retry

32:12.612 --> 32:12.917
Uhh, oops

32:17.869 --> 32:18.156
Uhh, oops

32:19.168 --> 32:20.138
It starts so fast!

32:20.901 --> 32:22.523
schlute

32:38.123 --> 32:38.305
Oh

33:12.152 --> 33:12.694
Okay okay!

33:15.363 --> 33:15.666
Okay!

33:19.914 --> 33:20.538
Okay!

33:22.410 --> 33:22.511
Oh!

33:24.243 --> 33:24.484
Oh!

33:27.484 --> 33:27.746
Oh!

33:30.021 --> 33:30.243
Oh!

33:33.283 --> 33:33.323
Oh!

33:38.148 --> 33:41.439
Oh, decent. I got decent, okay? Not bad.

33:42.523 --> 33:45.639
It's just...it's hard to get used to. It's starting so fast.

33:46.365 --> 33:47.234
I got one more, one more, one more.

33:48.666 --> 33:50.679
And we move to the next level after this.

33:55.484 --> 33:57.196
Wait, wait, wait. It wasn't ready, it wasn't ready.

33:57.840 --> 33:58.106
No no no...

33:58.967 --> 33:59.090
Sorry.

34:08.082 --> 34:09.034
It's confusing!

34:10.316 --> 34:10.418
Okay.

34:10.961 --> 34:13.946
It starts so fast!

34:40.744 --> 34:41.418
Oh, oops.

34:43.066 --> 34:43.312
Oops.

34:45.327 --> 34:45.554
Oh, wait.

34:46.067 --> 34:46.149
Uh...

34:49.923 --> 34:51.604
Okay, this part's easier.

35:14.463 --> 35:14.483
I

35:40.040 --> 35:48.259
worse than last time I feel like I can get it if it just yeah I feel like

35:48.561 --> 35:51.098
Actually, the beginning is harder for me, because... I don't know.

35:51.549 --> 35:51.591
XD

35:52.244 --> 35:52.426
Oops.

36:21.961 --> 36:24.880
I think I'm gonna go for the

36:25.001 --> 36:25.605
second one.

36:28.343 --> 36:28.645
Okay.

36:31.363 --> 36:33.135
I'm gonna go for the

36:34.081 --> 36:35.289
third one.

36:39.074 --> 36:39.457
Okay.

36:39.940 --> 36:41.007
I think I'm gonna go for the

36:43.403 --> 36:43.987
third one.

36:46.987 --> 36:47.289
Okay.

36:49.220 --> 36:51.283
UUUUHHH

37:06.622 --> 37:11.719
Okay, okay!

37:12.221 --> 37:12.805
Fuck!

37:19.506 --> 37:21.389
I just left a diamond, it's fine!

37:29.680 --> 37:30.837
I did it better than last time!

37:31.060 --> 37:32.060
Okay, okay.

37:32.060 --> 37:32.958
Let's go to the next one!

37:33.223 --> 37:34.040
I'm a professional!

37:34.060 --> 37:35.040
I'm a professional.

37:35.223 --> 37:36.040
Is this self-checkout?

37:36.080 --> 37:36.958
Wow, I got a ring!

37:37.080 --> 37:37.244
Tech.

37:38.121 --> 37:38.836
Tech.

37:39.162 --> 37:39.325
Tech.

37:40.182 --> 37:40.550
Tech.

37:41.693 --> 37:41.958
Tech.

37:42.427 --> 37:42.754
Tech.

37:43.448 --> 37:43.631
Tech.

37:44.387 --> 37:44.733
Tech.

37:45.424 --> 37:46.537
Check, check, check, check, check

37:49.261 --> 37:50.011
Wake up, wake up!

37:54.483 --> 37:55.333
All the pizza!

37:58.523 --> 37:58.912
Shooting!

38:00.362 --> 38:01.494
Okay, this should be easy, right?

38:02.781 --> 38:04.839
In this dream, shoot incoming enemies

38:05.101 --> 38:06.175
One beat after they appear

38:07.361 --> 38:08.538
Hold on, I gotta clear my throat

38:12.932 --> 38:13.054
Uhhh...

38:14.310 --> 38:14.754
Shoot enemies!

38:15.728 --> 38:15.809
Uh...

38:16.340 --> 38:17.136
One beat after they appear.

38:17.340 --> 38:21.119
Enemies on the bottom row will be harder to hit, since they appeared on off-beats.

38:21.789 --> 38:22.238
Uh...

38:22.340 --> 38:22.667
Okay.

38:23.830 --> 38:24.299
What does that mean?

38:25.360 --> 38:25.483
Okay...

38:26.769 --> 38:26.911
Okay...

38:27.564 --> 38:28.034
Okay...

38:28.605 --> 38:29.075
Okay...

38:29.524 --> 38:30.116
Okay...

38:30.340 --> 38:31.299
Okay...

38:31.564 --> 38:32.258
Okay...

38:32.748 --> 38:33.034
Okay...

38:33.809 --> 38:34.279
Okay...

38:34.809 --> 38:35.299
Okay...

38:35.769 --> 38:35.911
Okay...

38:36.789 --> 38:37.095
Okay...

38:37.422 --> 38:37.891
Okay...

38:38.481 --> 38:39.027
Oh

38:53.564 --> 38:54.393
Oh, okay

38:56.181 --> 38:57.603
Aw.

39:11.020 --> 39:15.349
Dadadada!

39:25.252 --> 39:26.856
Okay, I guess I'm ready.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.246
Those are the offbeat ones.

39:32.402 --> 39:32.906
Okay.

39:34.941 --> 39:37.772
We're gaming.

39:42.842 --> 39:43.363
only

39:49.621 --> 39:52.223
What is that?

40:13.804 --> 40:14.127
Caution?

40:45.680 --> 40:50.024
There's eight Grain

41:13.711 --> 41:14.753
Yay! Zero miss!

41:20.673 --> 41:21.357
Shooting staff...

41:22.705 --> 41:25.157
I think it's better for my brain. This is probably my favorite one so far.

41:26.945 --> 41:29.816
Yay! Hard mode already?

41:32.810 --> 41:33.433
Is it gonna be like a...

41:35.523 --> 41:37.452
Oh good okay not ready!

41:39.521 --> 41:40.743
Oh shit!

42:11.842 --> 42:12.903
Ahhh!

42:33.643 --> 42:34.674
Oh

43:05.329 --> 43:07.659
Okay, not bad, not bad

43:08.729 --> 43:09.376
We're gaming

43:09.861 --> 43:11.113
But this one feels so easy

43:13.270 --> 43:13.894
Too easy

43:15.527 --> 43:15.992
Too easy

43:16.942 --> 43:18.517
Alright, next

43:25.142 --> 43:29.099
The eyes of this character remind me of like a mob psycho

43:29.441 --> 43:30.189
Like a Reagan

43:31.866 --> 43:33.058
Good to good. It's the guns.

43:33.664 --> 43:34.431
Yeah, I think so.

43:36.462 --> 43:37.916
Okay, only two stars left.

43:38.542 --> 43:41.179
Let's go practice the followers mode.

43:42.967 --> 43:43.977
We're gonna like, cause it's like...

43:46.562 --> 43:48.615
In this stream you'll be jumping from platform to platform.

43:49.382 --> 43:50.157
We're going to Reddit!

43:51.144 --> 43:53.998
After landing, jump when the platform is about to launch you upward.

43:54.300 --> 43:56.199
Don't jump as soon as you touch the platform.

43:56.926 --> 43:57.613
Don't jump.

43:59.044 --> 44:01.978
Phone vibrations will act as cues for the more tricky parts.

44:10.886 --> 44:11.330
This is cute.

44:12.441 --> 44:14.813
A halloween

44:32.788 --> 44:33.814
Cute cute

44:35.883 --> 44:37.107
Cute, cute.

44:51.941 --> 44:54.095
Okay, okay. Maybe I get it.

44:55.121 --> 44:55.441
Oops

45:04.820 --> 45:07.528
I like this one

45:13.625 --> 45:14.066
Okay

45:19.907 --> 45:20.330
Okay

45:22.324 --> 45:23.978
There's no drugs, we're just dreaming.

45:24.504 --> 45:25.478
Dreams are crazy.

45:25.781 --> 45:27.638
I dreamt about Crony the other night, actually.

45:27.861 --> 45:29.076
I don't remember what it was, but...

45:29.961 --> 45:31.517
Well, I think she wanted something from me.

45:32.884 --> 45:34.075
And...Scorma, let's go!

45:47.448 --> 45:48.497
I'm gonna fall and die.

45:50.685 --> 45:55.339
What? What? What? What? What? What?

46:01.002 --> 46:02.153
Don't laugh emoji at me!

46:04.941 --> 46:05.709
Am I too early?

46:08.164 --> 46:11.012
Okay, it was too early.

46:13.940 --> 46:16.684
Am I getting them?

46:28.242 --> 46:29.145
I can't tell.

46:36.444 --> 46:40.108
I'm doing it just like in this tutorial!

46:51.100 --> 46:51.447
Speed up!

46:53.282 --> 47:03.559
I'm getting it.

47:04.400 --> 47:04.890
I'm winning.

47:05.380 --> 47:08.219
Oh my god, I'm winning.

47:09.930 --> 47:10.756
I'm winning!

47:19.935 --> 47:22.359
I can't tell if I'm doing it too early or too late.

47:23.144 --> 47:23.588
I don't know.

47:27.546 --> 47:28.228
Maybe I'll close my eyes.

47:33.981 --> 47:34.382
One.

47:39.061 --> 47:42.651
That worked!

48:09.020 --> 48:09.921
Oops, do I win?

48:34.820 --> 48:35.103
Speed up!!!

48:39.782 --> 48:40.523
It's working!

49:00.520 --> 49:05.477
As soon as I opened my eyes, I started to fail.

49:07.651 --> 49:08.459
It confuses me the...

49:09.510 --> 49:10.520
Why does it just vibrate?

49:10.560 --> 49:12.459
Like I have my eyes closed and I hear a vibration and it's just one.

49:12.622 --> 49:13.091
It's like bzzz.

49:14.571 --> 49:15.379
But I don't hear that BOOO!

49:16.104 --> 49:18.339
Where it throws you up in the air so it's confusing!

49:21.661 --> 49:23.237
Nice try, nice try.

49:23.663 --> 49:24.234
Hi.

49:26.112 --> 49:26.520
Yeah.

49:26.520 --> 49:27.275
I don't know.

49:27.560 --> 49:29.520
Does it vibrate? Me and I skip one beat.

49:30.490 --> 49:31.500
Vibrate is because it does a big jump.

49:32.928 --> 49:33.479
Okay, well.

49:34.651 --> 49:35.500
I need to get two stars!

49:37.944 --> 49:38.954
Restart!

49:46.002 --> 49:49.198
Oops, wait, does that count? I don't know, it didn't start yet. I have my eyes closed.

49:51.560 --> 49:52.469
Oops, oops, oops.

49:54.921 --> 49:55.342
okay

50:14.240 --> 50:14.987
okay oops okay

50:39.163 --> 50:40.395
uh i keep opening my eyes

50:40.961 --> 50:41.103
Ahh...

50:43.441 --> 50:45.799
The one where the vibration thing throws me off

50:46.082 --> 50:46.653
Vibrate and then...

50:48.264 --> 50:48.430
Okay

50:48.720 --> 50:48.981
rectangle!

51:19.100 --> 51:19.200
you

51:41.546 --> 51:43.817
What you doing?

51:45.800 --> 51:45.881
Ah!

51:59.405 --> 51:59.628
Ah

52:01.267 --> 52:01.974
Oh, where's the little king?

52:24.842 --> 52:27.520
Okay, okay, I'm getting the hang of it! I'm getting the hang of it!

52:27.621 --> 52:28.897
Okay, so when it goes blue...

52:29.140 --> 52:30.899
It's just that when it throws you up in the air, it's like...

52:31.681 --> 52:32.535
It's so quiet.

52:32.881 --> 52:33.775
I can hardly hear it.

52:35.681 --> 52:36.315
We start...

52:36.601 --> 52:37.535
Maybe it's my headphone, so...

52:38.900 --> 52:39.487
Progress!

52:40.621 --> 52:41.575
Yes, I did better, right?

52:43.072 --> 52:43.638
Missed the less.

53:42.061 --> 53:42.241
Ahh!

53:50.465 --> 53:50.565
Ahh!

53:56.241 --> 53:56.502
Ahh!

54:04.043 --> 54:04.344
Ahh!

54:15.771 --> 54:20.640
I keep pressing it! In the middle of the level change!

54:24.535 --> 54:25.097
Can't be loud.

54:28.935 --> 54:29.679
So close.

54:33.936 --> 54:34.820
Gotta jump jump.

54:35.342 --> 54:41.000
Okay, I have my eyes open. This isn't gonna work.

54:41.905 --> 54:44.820
I can't look. It messes me up. It must be the Reddit symbol!

54:44.860 --> 54:46.739
It's too cute!

55:07.342 --> 55:12.440
I opened my eyes because I was like it's gonna change now right and then I'll end up spamming it. Okay, it's the boom

55:12.742 --> 55:15.057
Why don't you hear that? I mean, STOP!

55:16.944 --> 55:17.044
NES

55:23.040 --> 55:23.141
by

55:36.380 --> 55:36.580
two

56:52.342 --> 56:53.545
Next up.

57:06.528 --> 57:09.610
Maybe if I look it'll be okay this time.

57:20.160 --> 57:27.687
I do better with my eyes

57:49.780 --> 57:56.786
eyes open eyes closed don't look

58:19.800 --> 58:22.584
I want to yell.

58:36.805 --> 58:40.736
No yelling.

58:42.240 --> 58:42.501
Frick.

58:48.261 --> 58:49.493
I hate social media!

58:53.303 --> 58:56.445
and nice relaxing in

59:14.864 --> 59:19.638
I'm never gonna pass!

59:22.586 --> 59:26.517
I'm never gonna pass!

59:27.941 --> 59:33.692
I'm gonna be stuck here forever!

59:37.500 --> 59:38.713
I'm never gonna pass

59:39.681 --> 59:42.395
I'm gonna be stuck here forever

01:00:04.243 --> 01:00:04.707
Now we wait

01:00:06.505 --> 01:00:06.747
okay

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.682
Okay, okay, speed up!

01:00:59.200 --> 01:00:59.321
Oh

01:01:01.604 --> 01:01:01.766
Oh

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.146
Oh, I got it!

01:01:10.301 --> 01:01:10.562
Okay.

01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:23.274
Yeah, it speeds up at the end.

01:01:27.261 --> 01:01:29.200
I think they all have a speed up in every level, huh?

01:01:29.882 --> 01:01:35.538
It's like a little speed up or slow down section where they change the BPM or whatever I don't know.

01:01:36.662 --> 01:01:41.180
Finally! Two stars. Two stars.

01:01:42.826 --> 01:01:43.352
I'm a pro.

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:47.898
I can't imagine the difficulty. Actually, should I try hard?

01:01:48.662 --> 01:01:52.899
I just want to try it once before I go into this mysterious whirlpool.

01:01:54.149 --> 01:01:54.715
One hard mode.

01:01:56.065 --> 01:01:58.480
With my eyes closed only eyes closed only

01:02:25.301 --> 01:02:25.968
Oh

01:02:29.262 --> 01:02:35.209
Oh frickin' dollar these jumps!

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.222
It's okay man.

01:03:07.686 --> 01:03:08.009
Chip!

01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:09.631
Ch!

01:03:10.381 --> 01:03:10.983
Chip!

01:03:17.481 --> 01:03:17.802
Chip!

01:03:24.621 --> 01:03:24.882

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:31.301

01:03:40.365 --> 01:03:47.159
Okay, okay, okay.

01:03:48.527 --> 01:03:49.052
How bad?

01:03:53.277 --> 01:03:53.659
Somewhat.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:55.678
We got a decent, we got a decent.

01:03:56.102 --> 01:03:57.072
Yeah!

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:59.826
We're finished.

01:04:05.284 --> 01:04:06.375
We beat the game.

01:04:06.981 --> 01:04:08.878
I'm just kidding, I think this is like the first level.

01:04:10.602 --> 01:04:11.316
The first mix!

01:04:11.702 --> 01:04:12.757
How many mixes are there?

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:15.577
Oh no no no no no!

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.602
P Organizations

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:02.320
Oops!

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:20.202
Eh.

01:05:36.283 --> 01:05:36.788
Fuck you!

01:05:40.161 --> 01:05:41.636
Okay, one store.

01:05:42.707 --> 01:05:43.131
Not bad.

01:05:44.224 --> 01:05:44.347
And...

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.297
Chill beats to study to, right?

01:05:53.901 --> 01:05:55.093
Waku, waku...

01:05:56.065 --> 01:05:56.371
Waku...

01:05:57.044 --> 01:05:57.432
Waku, waku...

01:05:59.642 --> 01:06:00.714
Waku, waku, waku...

01:06:01.506 --> 01:06:01.730
Again!

01:06:02.624 --> 01:06:03.452
Oh, it's gone!

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:04.302
Hey!

01:06:06.022 --> 01:06:08.806

Shit!

01:06:29.242 --> 01:06:29.583
Woops.

Fuck you!

01:07:11.302 --> 01:07:12.244
Okay, okay!

01:07:18.141 --> 01:07:19.846
Okay, okay.

01:07:26.202 --> 01:07:29.266
It's the Reddit part that messes me up.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:45.364
My eyes closed!

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:04.861
W Trust you

01:08:25.941 --> 01:08:29.045
I can still pass two stars with this.

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:39.427
Nevermind.

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:40.448
Nevermind.

01:08:41.407 --> 01:08:41.897
I can't.

01:08:42.162 --> 01:08:42.652

01:08:43.448 --> 01:08:44.060
Oh shit.

01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.856
Oops.

01:08:45.142 --> 01:08:45.652

Did I freeze? Okay.

01:10:20.922 --> 01:10:22.734
What the heck?

01:10:24.163 --> 01:10:26.957
Not two stars. I was so close.

Shh, gotta be quiet.

01:13:32.043 --> 01:13:32.928

01:14:11.705 --> 01:14:12.011
Must!

01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:15.096
Universities are

01:14:15.881 --> 01:14:16.544
Looking

01:14:19.702 --> 01:14:19.923
White

Wait a second, I have to get...

01:16:07.588 --> 01:16:08.255
Ah, shit.

01:16:09.588 --> 01:16:10.517
I thought that might have been it!

01:16:11.847 --> 01:16:13.780
This is a pretty game. The colors are nice.

01:16:13.901 --> 01:16:16.599
I think I did better on the phone part this time.

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:17.141
this time.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.741
Finally! Yay!

01:17:44.882 --> 01:17:45.553
Okay...

01:17:46.721 --> 01:17:48.459
Yeah, the social media part is hard.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:51.099
Cause I look at the animation and I'm like, okay now.

01:17:51.526 --> 01:17:51.934
Okay, now!

01:17:52.302 --> 01:17:52.792
Okay, now!

01:17:53.462 --> 01:17:53.749
But then...

01:17:54.501 --> 01:17:55.876
It's... I'm always too early.

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:57.563
Ta-da!

01:18:05.461 --> 01:18:07.718
Wake up! Time to sleep in a different part of the house!

01:18:10.882 --> 01:18:11.227
Night 2.

01:18:12.685 --> 01:18:13.755
Are we gonna sleep in the bed this time?

01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:14.953
Nah.

01:18:16.281 --> 01:18:16.934
That sounds nice.

01:18:21.705 --> 01:18:22.594
That song sounds familiar.

01:18:28.281 --> 01:18:28.893
What a banger.

01:18:29.784 --> 01:18:31.435
Hey, some of the pizza's gone. It's all coffee.

01:18:34.644 --> 01:18:36.139
Could you remember about exercise?

01:18:37.149 --> 01:18:37.372
Work?

01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:38.996
Money?

01:18:44.291 --> 01:18:45.139
Wow, this will be perfect.

01:18:46.205 --> 01:18:48.697
If only the stream wasn't gonna be so short.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:54.697
I guess if you guys wanna watch me play, you gotta wait until tomorrow.

01:18:55.702 --> 01:18:59.160
I might do two streams tomorrow. Oh no wait, nevermind. I have plans tomorrow. I forgot.

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:25.816
Might be somewhat similar to some other collab happening today, perhaps...

01:20:27.082 --> 01:20:29.320
Somehow connected in some way?

01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:30.360
You guys are the investigators.

01:20:31.066 --> 01:20:32.519
Put together the puzzle pieces!

01:20:32.681 --> 01:20:33.874
I almost said P, just P.

01:20:34.783 --> 01:20:36.476
Put together the puzzle pieces.

01:20:38.384 --> 01:20:38.792
Similar?

01:20:39.464 --> 01:20:40.274
Karaoke? No.

01:20:41.184 --> 01:20:42.256
Uh, I don't know. Wait, is it?

01:20:42.924 --> 01:20:43.755
Um, I don't know yet.

01:20:44.807 --> 01:20:45.798
We haven't talked about it.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:46.934
It's not GeoGuessr.

01:20:47.622 --> 01:20:49.256
It's not with any Myth members.

01:20:50.504 --> 01:20:53.097
Oh, I'll have to keep you guys on your toes!

01:20:54.924 --> 01:20:59.780
But since we have a little bit of time now, so I probably won't continue this game tomorrow, but maybe what I'll do...

01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:02.156
Hold on, I gotta look at my schedule anyways.

01:21:03.767 --> 01:21:05.518
I don't know if I have something I'm supposed to do.

01:21:09.888 --> 01:21:16.680
I could have done yeah I didn't participate in the apex thing because

01:21:17.483 --> 01:21:22.700
there were some scheduling stuff going on with all this 3d stuff happening in

01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:31.420
Japan I wasn't sure if I would be able to do the apex tournaments that Ollie's

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:36.839
doing. I told her, I was like, sorry Ali, I wish I could join, but I don't think it's possible

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:45.020
with some stuff I'm doing with 3D in Japan and whatnot. So yeah, I would have participated

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:56.800
otherwise though. So, um, the day after tomorrow? Is that- oh, that's gonna be Ina's thingy?

01:21:58.683 --> 01:22:09.680
Oh my god, exciting. After Ina's 3D debut, we can play this game.

01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:14.197
Or Fallout New Vegas, either way.

01:22:17.993 --> 01:22:19.679
Maybe both? Perhaps both?

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:20.503
Yeah.

01:22:25.363 --> 01:22:28.659
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:30.315
Okay, that sounds good.

01:22:34.011 --> 01:22:36.679
I haven't read the Super Chats in a while since we have a little bit of time left.

01:22:37.724 --> 01:22:39.935
I'm gonna read the Super Chats from the stream.

01:22:41.121 --> 01:22:45.378
I might be like that for a while where I'll just sometimes I'll read the Super Chats.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.395
Sometimes I might not have time.

01:22:48.867 --> 01:22:50.639
Yeah, what time for stream tomorrow?

01:22:52.789 --> 01:22:53.820
I don't know. Sorry.

01:22:55.244 --> 01:22:56.638
I'm stuck. I don't know.

01:22:58.161 --> 01:23:08.860
Probably after like 5pm JST, which would be pretty late for you guys, but you know, it's just the way the world operates on this side.

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:12.574
Where's my thingy?

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:13.207
Alright.

01:23:16.167 --> 01:23:20.640
I'm gonna read Super Chats and then I have to end the stream because I got some stuff

01:23:20.742 --> 01:23:21.374
I gotta write up.

01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:22.546
I gotta write up a report.

01:23:24.946 --> 01:23:25.048
AHHH!

01:23:27.649 --> 01:23:28.834
Well, time for the game streams.

01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:32.495
Probably like...maybe...earliest?

01:23:33.261 --> 01:23:33.806
No no no.

01:23:35.581 --> 01:23:42.419
Well, the game streams will be on the same day as Ina's 3D debut, so it'll be afterwards,

01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:44.176
Which will be pretty late for you guys, so...

01:23:44.982 --> 01:23:46.231
Probably be like around 3pm...

01:23:48.701 --> 01:23:51.217
JST, which is pretty late for you guys.

01:23:52.842 --> 01:23:54.034
Gomenasai.

01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:58.935
Gomen-e tsumimasen.

01:24:02.043 --> 01:24:04.117
Onto tsumimasen.

01:24:05.842 --> 01:24:07.438
Oh my god, it's so embarrassing. I uh...

01:24:07.963 --> 01:24:09.499
Forgot my wallet.

01:24:09.701 --> 01:24:10.953
Well, I like left my bag

01:24:13.105 --> 01:24:14.620
As we went to go do some stuff yesterday

01:24:19.269 --> 01:24:19.431
And

01:24:21.801 --> 01:24:26.680
Oh yeah, I stopped the convenient was by myself. I was like I'm not gonna go out tomorrow

01:24:27.685 --> 01:24:29.160
I'm gonna record and stream stuff

01:24:30.938 --> 01:24:31.020
and

01:24:31.381 --> 01:24:36.820
I only had like this little coin purse on me, and so I tried to buy some snacks and

01:24:37.925 --> 01:24:40.237
And I realized that I was just short like 500 yen

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:47.859
So I was standing at the cash register putting in like little 10 yen coins

01:24:48.942 --> 01:24:52.138
My little 30 yen coins my little 1 yen coins

01:24:53.362 --> 01:24:57.940
And I was like Sumimasen Sumimasen and there were coins falling out of my pocket on the floor

01:24:59.023 --> 01:25:01.920
And then I ended up not having enough after I put in all my coins

01:25:03.583 --> 01:25:04.876
Because I had so much change

01:25:06.745 --> 01:25:11.000
I didn't have my card so then I had to put it in Google Translate.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.620
I was like, can we remove one item?

01:25:14.122 --> 01:25:16.713
Can we remove a few items and do it again?

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.659
So I had to remove like two things.

01:25:21.281 --> 01:25:26.818
It was a smoothie drink, a healthy smoothie drink and a type of bread.

01:25:28.247 --> 01:25:29.094
Maybe it was for the best.

01:25:29.901 --> 01:25:32.140
It was embarrassing.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.117
I was like, I was like, Sumimasen! Sumimasen!

01:25:35.661 --> 01:25:36.414
And then I ran out.

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:37.331
It was...

01:25:38.823 --> 01:25:40.020
Scary. Scary.

01:25:40.121 --> 01:25:40.894
No, no, no. The...

01:25:41.881 --> 01:25:43.420
The cash person was really nice.

01:25:43.543 --> 01:25:43.974
They were like,

01:25:44.261 --> 01:25:45.536
Taijuu butte s! Taijuu butte s!

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:47.253
They were laughing.

01:25:47.984 --> 01:25:48.229
At me!

01:25:49.503 --> 01:25:49.769
Anyways.

01:25:50.983 --> 01:25:51.571
Super chats.

01:25:57.322 --> 01:25:58.478
Nice mansion, thank you!

01:25:58.822 --> 01:26:01.098
A melatonin. I should've named the stream that.

01:26:03.001 --> 01:26:04.357
Delna. Thank you.

01:26:05.621 --> 01:26:07.357
That's a good JP time.

01:26:07.841 --> 01:26:10.357
Konnichiwa-chan, konbanwa.

01:26:11.241 --> 01:26:12.154
Kyo wa.

01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:17.237
Kyo no haishin wa.

01:26:18.222 --> 01:26:18.810
Owari.

01:26:26.835 --> 01:26:29.120
More streams at this time, some people say.

01:26:29.623 --> 01:26:30.492
No, no, please.

01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:38.160
Yeah I haven't, I've also been not streaming so much because I'm trying to stick with the

01:26:38.321 --> 01:26:40.334
appropriate time zone for some of you guys.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:44.635
But also that time passes because that's like the perfect time that I sleep.

01:26:47.489 --> 01:26:48.976
So, uh, I'll try to mix it up.

01:26:50.925 --> 01:26:53.957
This time is good for EU. All the EU mates.

01:26:57.463 --> 01:27:00.535
And I have a JP translator. Arigatou gozaimasu.

01:27:03.207 --> 01:27:05.036
Nihongo kawaii.

01:27:05.862 --> 01:27:06.127
Zenzen!

01:27:07.346 --> 01:27:07.669
Chikau!

01:27:11.594 --> 01:27:12.559
Good for EU.

01:27:13.424 --> 01:27:15.216
Well, we're gonna have a stream tomorrow.

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.357
Not at this time. Probably a little bit earlier than this stream.

01:27:19.161 --> 01:27:24.053
Probably? I'm thinking probably, yeah. Maybe like 7, 6 p.m. JST.

01:27:29.649 --> 01:27:29.992
I don't know.

01:27:31.243 --> 01:27:32.995
Maybe, maybe, thank you. See you in the vlog.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:34.311
Thank you.

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:35.120
It

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.189
From...

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:07.829
Probably from...

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:09.589
I don't know...

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:11.815
Dancing or something?

01:28:13.882 --> 01:28:14.536
Maybe it's from...

01:28:15.303 --> 01:28:15.609
Bread?

01:28:16.401 --> 01:28:16.931
Nah, no, no.

01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:19.538
I only got sick after eating Domino's pizza.

01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:23.311
The pizza!

01:28:23.923 --> 01:28:24.655
It was the pizza!

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:27.677
Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm still gonna eat.

01:28:28.441 --> 01:28:30.338
I'll eat gluten while I'm here, and then...

01:28:30.722 --> 01:28:31.856
I'll stop when I go back...

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:33.855
When I go back home.

01:28:34.645 --> 01:28:35.392
No gluten.

01:28:38.221 --> 01:28:40.039
Ah, Amiri-S, thank you. Just in case, you know.

01:28:40.786 --> 01:28:41.918
Half-wing, thank you.

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:47.616
How do you think about... Oh, how does it feel to live in Japan?

01:28:49.382 --> 01:28:50.897
Uh, it's alright. Yeah, it's pretty good.

01:28:51.402 --> 01:28:53.616
All the food is just like too good and I'm like...

01:28:54.642 --> 01:28:58.939
Man, I want my home-cooked food, but I don't have any like cooking utensils.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:02.215
And I'm not gonna buy any because I'm not gonna take it back with me.

01:29:03.982 --> 01:29:10.620
So, you know, I'm just eating dinner outside ordering food and I order food and it all

01:29:10.801 --> 01:29:15.380
builds up and I have all this plastic and trash and cardboard and you have to dispose

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.688
of food like separately and it's confusing.

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:22.613
The food, all the food is too good.

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:24.026
It's too good!

01:29:26.567 --> 01:29:28.258
Yeah, it's, it's, you know, it's pretty nice.

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:32.379
Although when I stay inside I feel like I miss so much of-

01:29:32.702 --> 01:29:33.752
Because there's such a busy...

01:29:35.225 --> 01:29:37.520
Everybody's so busy! Everybody's walking around, you know?

01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:41.480
Like the busiest person in the world, everybody's a CEO walking around and I'm-

01:29:42.025 --> 01:29:43.116
I'm like staying inside.

01:29:44.104 --> 01:29:45.594
I stay inside for like two days.

01:29:47.022 --> 01:29:49.816
You know, and I feel like the world just passes me by.

01:29:50.742 --> 01:29:52.176
The time here feels different.

01:29:52.782 --> 01:29:55.500
You know, when I'm at home, I just lay in bed, you know?

01:29:56.183 --> 01:30:00.500
Sit on my couch, look at my fish tanks, and the time just passes by so easily.

01:30:00.942 --> 01:30:05.420
But here I'm just like, everybody's out and doing stuff and I'm just in here.

01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:09.279
Just watching my anime, playing some games.

01:30:10.625 --> 01:30:13.339
And then I go outside and it's like...

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:15.459
Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy.

01:30:20.683 --> 01:30:21.520
That's good motivation.

01:30:22.421 --> 01:30:33.540
Yeah yeah. Time is so precious here for everybody. Good, it's good. Time should always be precious, right? No matter where you are.

01:30:33.702 --> 01:30:33.823
I'm a

01:30:40.664 --> 01:30:41.432
Thank you

01:30:43.465 --> 01:30:43.950
I'm in the a

01:30:47.304 --> 01:30:48.900
Nice backing track we have

01:30:49.824 --> 01:30:50.874
Good I thank you

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:57.880
TK thank you. I'm at a donut. I hope I can help you sleep. Maybe maybe I wasn't too loud, right?

01:30:58.829 --> 01:30:59.254
Thank you

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:33.539
I've been good about it before, made sure to educate myself and look into everything

01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:37.856
I'm like, oh, you know, obviously I knew before, it's like, oh, company in Japan, cool

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:46.958
But now that I'm actually here, I'm actually here and working for, you know, a Japanese company

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:49.209
Pretty crazy to think about

01:31:51.221 --> 01:31:59.040
Pretty crazy where you can end up if you just you just keep trying and go with the flow and you know

01:32:00.723 --> 01:32:03.900
All done wait out for some opportunities

01:32:05.704 --> 01:32:06.776
Pretty crazy

01:32:07.582 --> 01:32:10.540
Yeah, I think I just got lucky. I got really lucky

01:32:11.864 --> 01:32:13.659
I'm lucky to have you guys too

01:32:15.362 --> 01:32:19.100
What a ride. I know it's so crazy. I still can't believe it. I'll be like walking around

01:32:19.281 --> 01:32:23.980
I'd be like walking around Japan and I'm like what the fuck am I doing here?

01:32:25.904 --> 01:32:26.732
Why am I here?

01:32:28.184 --> 01:32:29.999
It's crazy, especially oh like the first day I

01:32:31.621 --> 01:32:35.620
arrived back here. I was super dizzy because I hadn't slept in like

01:32:36.883 --> 01:32:40.540
30 something hours. I had slept for like a few hours on the plane

01:32:41.361 --> 01:32:47.080
Here and then when I got here, I was like, oh, yeah, let's go. And so then I was like, let's go

01:32:47.322 --> 01:32:49.100
Let's go play some claw machines or something

01:32:51.881 --> 01:32:52.588
And then

01:32:54.122 --> 01:32:58.400
Yeah, I was up for a really long time and I was super dizzy walking around I'd be like staring at the ground like

01:32:59.464 --> 01:33:01.380
My am I dreaming is this real?

01:33:02.665 --> 01:33:03.352
I'm so dizzy

01:33:05.244 --> 01:33:07.520
And but I play claw machine anyways, it was fun

01:33:09.423 --> 01:33:12.000
And then I had a nice long sleep

01:33:13.166 --> 01:33:15.538
Oh, so champs, thank you!

01:33:18.347 --> 01:33:18.510
Any...

01:33:19.826 --> 01:33:22.000
Offline co-op mo- oh, game?

01:33:22.444 --> 01:33:23.657
Offline co-op games?

01:33:24.764 --> 01:33:27.618
Yeah, that'd be fun. We're planning some stuff.

01:33:28.388 --> 01:33:28.980
Some things.

01:33:29.889 --> 01:33:30.980
Now, Jimmy-san, arigato!

01:33:31.926 --> 01:33:33.456
A-me-chan kawaii!

01:33:36.788 --> 01:33:37.475
No, no.

01:33:38.384 --> 01:33:39.678
Fong dang source, thank you.

01:33:40.062 --> 01:33:41.136
Slack armor, thank you.

01:33:42.221 --> 01:33:44.218
Rhythm game homework for dance lessons.

01:33:45.984 --> 01:33:46.877
Yeah, um...

01:33:47.221 --> 01:33:48.236
My rhythm is pretty good.

01:33:48.964 --> 01:33:50.096
You know, a lot of...

01:33:51.141 --> 01:33:54.078
You guys could tell, right? While watching, right? It's pretty good.

01:33:55.626 --> 01:33:56.196
I, uh...

01:33:56.521 --> 01:33:59.017
I have some more dance lessons coming up, so...

01:33:59.582 --> 01:34:00.575
Looking forward to them.

01:34:01.743 --> 01:34:02.574
It really helps...

01:34:03.283 --> 01:34:04.034
Having...

01:34:04.562 --> 01:34:05.613
Somebody teach you and...

01:34:06.786 --> 01:34:08.119
Be there as like a reference

01:34:10.903 --> 01:34:11.126
Thank you!

01:34:12.221 --> 01:34:12.388

01:34:14.924 --> 01:34:15.496
Not Niwa

01:34:16.762 --> 01:34:17.054
Wani

01:34:18.512 --> 01:34:18.679
Wani

01:34:19.282 --> 01:34:20.078
Wait, didn't we learn this?

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.594
Well then I gotta clear my throat too

01:34:26.690 --> 01:34:27.118
Wrong thing

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:30.833
Okay

01:34:33.302 --> 01:34:33.955

Subaru Senpai

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:08.295
I saw her briefly

01:35:08.761 --> 01:35:10.094
But just briefly, I uh...

01:35:10.782 --> 01:35:11.919
Was being rushed into a meeting

01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:13.160
Cause I was late, so I was like

01:35:13.243 --> 01:35:13.347
Oh!

01:35:13.822 --> 01:35:14.593
Oh! Hello!

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.173
Hello! Oh! Okay, bye!

01:35:16.842 --> 01:35:17.190

01:35:21.262 --> 01:35:22.236
Envy, thank you

01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:24.894
Today's a good day

01:35:27.121 --> 01:35:27.511

01:35:28.061 --> 01:35:32.431

01:35:36.143 --> 01:35:37.739
Thank you.

01:35:38.749 --> 01:35:39.840
Translate this too.

01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:40.143
Inseo. Wait.

01:35:42.406 --> 01:35:42.951
Yeah. Inseo.

01:35:43.921 --> 01:35:44.668
Thank you.

01:35:45.981 --> 01:35:47.739
David C. Thank you.

01:35:47.901 --> 01:35:49.719
Game looks good.

01:35:49.981 --> 01:35:51.699
I'm going to translate this.

01:35:52.466 --> 01:35:52.931
Thank you.

01:35:54.103 --> 01:35:55.678
I'm going to translate this.

01:35:56.241 --> 01:36:01.780
Oh, game looks good. Yeah, I'm glad um, I don't know who

01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:07.200
Requested this game, but I was like too lazy to request this game, even though I saw it a long time ago

01:36:08.223 --> 01:36:10.840
So I'm glad that I randomly found it today because I was like

01:36:12.001 --> 01:36:17.720
What am I gonna stream? I don't wanna, I mean I wanna play in New Vegas, but I don't like having

01:36:19.063 --> 01:36:20.558
Streams. Oh god, am I dead?

01:36:21.362 --> 01:36:25.318
I don't like having so many streams in a row

01:36:25.841 --> 01:36:26.290
I don't know

01:36:28.507 --> 01:36:29.760
Hellsinging, thank you

01:36:30.366 --> 01:36:31.800
Thank you, I appreciate the support

01:36:32.972 --> 01:36:33.699
Into Mopi, thank you

01:36:35.026 --> 01:36:37.498
Metal Hellsinger might be a nightmare mode

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:38.678
Is that a game?

01:36:41.265 --> 01:36:42.578
Yeah, they should do nightmare mode of this

01:36:43.167 --> 01:36:43.555
Spooky

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:45.578
And then they should have the songs but like

01:36:46.285 --> 01:36:47.618
As metal or something instead

01:36:48.865 --> 01:36:51.378
It reminds me of that one game, Rainbow Unicorn.

01:36:52.283 --> 01:36:54.740
Didn't they have a version like that? I think.

01:36:55.224 --> 01:36:56.255
Dorgio, thank you.

01:36:58.623 --> 01:37:02.218
I heard you used Rococo mocap suit for Kiara's birthday a couple months ago.

01:37:02.921 --> 01:37:05.740
No, we did not use that for her birthday, no.

01:37:06.062 --> 01:37:07.995
It was different technology.

01:37:11.628 --> 01:37:12.800
Rococo suit is pretty good, yeah.

01:37:13.141 --> 01:37:17.559
It's pretty expensive if you have the money if you're willing to spend it.

01:37:18.141 --> 01:37:25.078
They're always making improvements on the software so yeah it's pretty good it can be pretty good.

01:37:27.922 --> 01:37:28.392
Thank you.

01:37:29.706 --> 01:37:30.854
Moku moku moku.

01:37:32.344 --> 01:37:34.075
Moku moku yummy.

01:37:35.083 --> 01:37:36.800
Is there a low-fi version of moku moku yummy?

01:37:37.807 --> 01:37:39.136
Wang shouren, thank you.

01:37:40.063 --> 01:37:41.376

Ah yeah, I like the shooting one the best so far, but...

01:37:50.366 --> 01:37:51.800
We'll have to see what other levels there are

01:37:52.042 --> 01:37:54.377
Cause I have no idea, I've only seen like a few different...

01:37:55.487 --> 01:37:56.558
Things from this game before

01:37:58.183 --> 01:38:00.639
So I'm interested to see what the other ones are

01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.886
I'm back in a dream with these stages.

01:38:08.543 --> 01:38:11.916
I'm back in a dream with these stages.

01:40:30.222 --> 01:40:32.000
A morning stream, get to watch instead of doing work.

01:40:32.543 --> 01:40:35.040
No, no, no. Get back to work. This dream's ending.

01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:36.369
Jojo1229, thank you.

01:40:38.888 --> 01:40:40.040
Import bread from Japan now.

01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:42.040
Yeah, we'll see.

01:40:43.747 --> 01:40:46.658
I think I am better when it's...

01:40:47.322 --> 01:40:49.134
Japan, Japanese gluten.

01:40:50.944 --> 01:40:55.040
But I'm gonna do some more experimenting once I'm completely off gluten when I go back home.

01:40:56.725 --> 01:40:58.959
And then I'll try something that's like...

01:40:59.886 --> 01:41:02.040
You know, American gluten or something like that.

01:41:02.101 --> 01:41:03.040
And then like another country.

01:41:03.201 --> 01:41:05.839
And just see if anything happens.

01:41:08.262 --> 01:41:09.717
JHGardener, thank you!

01:41:11.704 --> 01:41:14.040
Oh, thank you. Yeah, dancing has been pretty fun.

01:41:14.545 --> 01:41:15.899
Oh, oh, stuck!

01:41:16.824 --> 01:41:20.059
Oh, today's thank you! 9AM EST, so it's not bad.

01:41:20.341 --> 01:41:21.735
Whatever time works best.

01:41:22.421 --> 01:41:25.198
Yeah, it'll be probably pretty early in the morning for you guys.

01:41:26.823 --> 01:41:28.197
Dancing's been super fun.

01:41:28.985 --> 01:41:30.217
Just in time! Ah, thank you!

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:32.453
Kourasai! Ah, thank you!

01:41:33.903 --> 01:41:36.218
I know, it's so nice to just... I'm just like the type of person...

01:41:37.263 --> 01:41:40.335
I just like to be alone. You know, inside, alone.

01:41:42.487 --> 01:41:43.654
Sometimes doing nothing.

01:41:44.965 --> 01:41:46.238
Sometimes just existing.

01:41:47.782 --> 01:41:50.379
But definitely it feels like the time passes by...

01:41:51.904 --> 01:41:53.137
In the worst way possible.

01:41:53.662 --> 01:41:54.652
When I go outside and...

01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:57.480
Everybody's, you know, living their life.

01:41:57.864 --> 01:41:58.611
Busy as heck.

01:41:59.642 --> 01:42:00.773
Doing all the cool stuff.

01:42:04.023 --> 01:42:06.917
But for now, just focusing on working hard.

01:42:07.782 --> 01:42:10.817
And then we'll take some breaks and do some fun stuff.

01:42:11.642 --> 01:42:12.834
Fusquia-la, thank you.

01:42:13.905 --> 01:42:14.756
As well, down.

01:42:17.462 --> 01:42:18.657
Yuen Xing, thank you.

01:42:19.866 --> 01:42:20.434
Oh, thank you.

01:42:21.001 --> 01:42:22.777
Belated Valentine's Chocolate.

01:42:23.362 --> 01:42:25.877
Ooh, I booked the Halloween Collab Cafe.

01:42:26.463 --> 01:42:27.294
Nice, yeah.

01:42:28.064 --> 01:42:28.974
Book while you can.

01:42:29.723 --> 01:42:30.474
Thank you, thank you.

01:42:31.564 --> 01:42:32.376
I'm looking forward to it.

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:35.217
We've done some special stuff at the Collab Cafe.

01:42:35.943 --> 01:42:36.875
It opened recently.

01:42:37.583 --> 01:42:39.016
So, it'll be pretty cool.

01:42:40.008 --> 01:42:40.535
And then...

01:42:41.561 --> 01:42:42.294
What was I gonna say?

01:42:43.303 --> 01:42:45.916
Oh yeah! And then...on White Day...

01:42:47.445 --> 01:42:49.378
I wonder what we'll do. Actually, I don't know...

01:42:51.326 --> 01:42:52.397
Is that...what day is that again?

01:42:53.303 --> 01:42:53.725
March...14th?

01:42:58.962 --> 01:43:01.096
Oh? Isn't that Pi Day?

01:43:04.841 --> 01:43:06.895
I'll go to Halyun Cafe! Yatta!

01:43:11.972 --> 01:43:14.379
And Miku Day. White Day Miku Day, Pie Day.

01:43:15.367 --> 01:43:16.195
There's too many holidays!

01:43:17.731 --> 01:43:18.094
Alright.

01:43:20.448 --> 01:43:21.236
Yeah, we'll do something.

01:43:23.266 --> 01:43:24.539
And Crony's birthday?

01:43:28.323 --> 01:43:31.057
We might have to celebrate White Day like a day later or something.

01:43:31.842 --> 01:43:32.670
Maybe a day early.

01:43:34.569 --> 01:43:35.054
Bubba Day?

01:43:35.781 --> 01:43:37.458
No, it wasn't that in January

01:43:38.381 --> 01:43:39.092
Wait, what day is it?

01:43:40.381 --> 01:43:40.808
Miku is 3-9?

01:43:42.383 --> 01:43:42.611
Oh yeah

01:43:43.802 --> 01:43:44.313
That makes sense

01:43:47.264 --> 01:43:47.447
That's it

01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:49.866
G086, thank you

01:43:52.141 --> 01:43:53.216
Meiten, thank you

01:43:54.883 --> 01:43:55.595
During work

01:43:56.023 --> 01:43:56.635
Tsk tsk

01:43:57.381 --> 01:43:58.837
Attack a goalie, thank you

01:43:59.727 --> 01:44:00.195
Oh, nice

01:44:01.121 --> 01:44:02.054
Thank you, thank you

01:44:02.602 --> 01:44:03.358
Have a nice day

01:44:03.662 --> 01:44:04.126
Alpha9571, thank you!

01:44:06.884 --> 01:44:07.611
Oh, thank you!

01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:09.753
TK, thank you!

01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:11.854
Yes, everybody's working really hard.

01:44:13.124 --> 01:44:14.775
We've been working and waiting...

01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:18.037
for this time for our 3D debut in Japan!

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:20.106
Everybody, shoot that...

01:44:23.103 --> 01:44:25.334
Uh, have you sniffed all of Halloween yet?

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:27.328
No, not yet.

01:44:28.581 --> 01:44:30.473
I don't know, I'm a mouth breather, so I don't like...

01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:32.490
I don't really...

01:44:34.103 --> 01:44:36.897
You know, it's not really my first thought to sniff someone.

01:44:39.763 --> 01:44:41.137
I don't know, is that... I guess...

01:44:41.701 --> 01:44:43.654
For you guys, it's probably like first thought, huh?

01:44:46.025 --> 01:44:47.258
Jirozaki, thank you!

01:44:51.264 --> 01:44:53.937
Getting this game just to see if it's really as hard as you've shown.

01:44:56.245 --> 01:44:58.460
It's probably... It'll probably be easier for you guys, I bet.

01:44:59.645 --> 01:45:03.400
If you try this game, you'll probably do better than I will. For sure.

01:45:04.426 --> 01:45:05.292
I'm gonna say, thank you.

01:45:07.147 --> 01:45:08.480
Oh, thank you. Very comfy.

01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:11.480
I've been out of college, thank you so much for the big stuff.

01:45:12.467 --> 01:45:13.473
Thank you, thank you.

01:45:17.923 --> 01:45:19.997
No, I haven't eaten any pizza off the bathroom floor.

01:45:20.847 --> 01:45:21.092
I think.

01:45:22.248 --> 01:45:22.854
But I know of.

01:45:23.844 --> 01:45:24.854
Thank you so much for the support.

01:45:25.781 --> 01:45:30.078
The Rock. Thank you. Wow, The Rock. The real The Rock.

01:45:31.324 --> 01:45:34.460
Can I say it? Thank you. Yes, Happy Lady Valentine's Day, everyone.

01:45:35.525 --> 01:45:37.797
X-Wow, thank you. Bubba Day is June 2nd.

01:45:39.604 --> 01:45:43.319
Bubba Day, Bubba Day. Contest, thank you. Hello, Reddit.

01:45:44.106 --> 01:45:45.278
Eskoma, thank you.

01:45:46.022 --> 01:45:51.380
How do Gooda's feet feel? Well, I had my feet under the coffee table.

01:45:52.142 --> 01:45:57.480
You know, and I had them in the middle because nobody else had their feet under the coffee table.

01:45:57.864 --> 01:45:59.399
And Gura was sitting like across from me.

01:46:00.725 --> 01:46:04.460
And then, you know, later into the stream she decided to put her feet under there.

01:46:05.304 --> 01:46:08.279
In my territory, okay? I was there first.

01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:11.480
And, uh, yeah we were both wearing socks.

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:13.997
That was pretty soft I guess.

01:46:14.742 --> 01:46:16.836
The socks were soft. And warm.

01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:24.440
But everything there was like soft and warm. It was nice.

01:46:24.983 --> 01:46:27.259
The carpet was really soft. The cats were really soft.

01:46:28.308 --> 01:46:28.854
It was nice.

01:46:33.426 --> 01:46:35.218
Okay. I'm gonna end the stream now.

01:46:35.702 --> 01:46:37.419
I'm gonna go check out the karaoke.

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:39.848
Oh my god, the dropped frames are 0.2% which is 666.

01:46:43.983 --> 01:46:45.775
Dropped frames! What does it mean?

01:46:47.044 --> 01:46:49.198
Okay, you guys have two more minutes and then I'm ending the stream.

01:46:50.264 --> 01:46:50.867
I can get it at 1.50.

01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:03.514
Aye! Spooky!

01:47:14.233 --> 01:47:16.957
Thank you for the stream, thank you guys for watching!

01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:21.791
I've not used a kotatsu before.

01:47:23.561 --> 01:47:24.479
Never used before.

01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:26.237
What am I eating?

01:47:27.623 --> 01:47:32.976
What am I eating? I'm not eating anything right now but today I had some leftover

01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:41.719
meat darashidango. I had pineapple and I've been trying to eat a lot of veggies so

01:47:42.341 --> 01:47:48.220
I got some vegetable curry with some chicken on the side. That's what I had for dinner

01:47:49.682 --> 01:47:56.160
and honestly I've been eating a lot of udon also. I love like as a konbine, like the market, they

01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:08.360
They have this take home udon thing and it comes with like, not frozen, but like congealed broth jelly.

01:48:08.921 --> 01:48:17.180
Sounds weird, but the noodles are sitting on top of like these cubes of jelly and then you microwave it and they melt and then it turns into tasty broth.

01:48:17.983 --> 01:48:20.638
I don't know, I love udon so much. Udon is so good!

01:48:24.010 --> 01:48:26.458
Instant udon? No, it's like pre-prepared

01:48:30.464 --> 01:48:32.000
Do I eat together with other members?

01:48:32.765 --> 01:48:34.819
Yeah, we've been going to eat at some places

01:48:35.323 --> 01:48:36.717
We had like yakiniku

01:48:37.725 --> 01:48:39.476
And we had some... I don't know...

01:48:40.282 --> 01:48:41.656
I don't know what kind of place it was

01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:44.959
Oh yeah, it had a... What is it called? A bulgogi

01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:47.537
Yeah, tasty bulgogi

01:48:48.403 --> 01:48:50.058
Bugogi? Bugogi

01:48:55.086 --> 01:48:56.838
And...had...what else?

01:49:01.901 --> 01:49:06.279
I can't think of anything else. Oh, we've gone to like, cafes, some cafes

01:49:06.903 --> 01:49:08.756
We had some cake together

01:49:09.441 --> 01:49:12.520
We went to like, a family restaurant

01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:16.118
We had some tasty food

01:49:17.748 --> 01:49:19.258
That a little robot brought us.

01:49:19.822 --> 01:49:20.954
Very tasty.

01:49:24.563 --> 01:49:25.998
Nah, I haven't been to a maid cafe.

01:49:28.424 --> 01:49:29.016
I've never been.

01:49:30.424 --> 01:49:30.893
Never been.

01:49:33.541 --> 01:49:38.538
Yeah, we're gonna do GeoGuessr collab, but we still have a long time to plan it, and we're all kind of busy at the moment.

01:49:40.064 --> 01:49:43.240
I think just now we're getting a few breaker days, but I don't wanna be like, you know...

01:49:44.106 --> 01:49:45.173
Alright, come on, let's get on this!

01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:47.314
Everybody's been working really hard, so...

01:49:47.881 --> 01:49:49.275
Having some nice, relaxing time...

01:49:50.164 --> 01:49:51.258
To ourselves, we'll be good.

01:49:51.521 --> 01:49:53.578
And then...we'll fit in collabs here and there.

01:49:55.982 --> 01:49:56.770
Especially after...

01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:01.118
You know, we finish a lot of the bulk of the 3D streams.

01:50:01.765 --> 01:50:02.414
We'll have time.

01:50:05.885 --> 01:50:06.375
Alright...

01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:09.458
I'm gonna end the stream now. Thank you guys for watching.

01:50:09.962 --> 01:50:12.334
I'll see you tomorrow, special guest collab!

01:50:13.621 --> 01:50:15.128
Woah woah woah! Let's go!

01:50:17.662 --> 01:50:19.379
Let's go with it, bye!
