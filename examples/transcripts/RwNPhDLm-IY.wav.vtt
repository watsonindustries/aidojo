WEBVTT

00:01.261 --> 00:02.341
This is super chill

00:02.501 --> 00:05.122
Hopefully

00:06.283 --> 00:09.284
Relaxing time

00:09.404 --> 00:11.405
I think we're live

00:11.805 --> 00:12.345
Are we live?

00:12.525 --> 00:13.145
Hello

00:13.265 --> 00:13.966
Hello

00:14.226 --> 00:14.786
We're live

00:14.906 --> 00:15.726
Yay

00:15.967 --> 00:17.147
Can you guys hear us?

00:17.167 --> 00:19.208
The familiar emotes

00:21.850 --> 00:23.290
The ones you're comfortable with

00:25.351 --> 00:26.992
Ame is helping me so much

00:27.132 --> 00:29.273
Ame is setting up my stream for me, look

00:29.653 --> 00:31.994
Here, we're using her Overly and everything

00:32.414 --> 00:33.175
And her setup, thank you

00:33.335 --> 00:34.435
I can change the color of it

00:34.495 --> 00:35.035
Here, wait, wait, wait

00:35.235 --> 00:36.496
Oh, you can just be super fast

00:36.596 --> 00:36.916
Oops

00:37.256 --> 00:38.197
You guys don't see anything

00:38.737 --> 00:40.518
No, no, this is my Overly now

00:40.538 --> 00:46.100
And now I'll just see you really quick.

00:48.497 --> 00:49.417
We do like a...

00:50.057 --> 00:50.698
Oh, we should do...

00:50.718 --> 00:52.058
Like a kind of gray?

00:52.178 --> 00:53.618
Yeah, we should do a gray.

00:53.718 --> 00:54.338
Oh, this is nice.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.019
Oh, this is nice?

00:55.039 --> 00:56.059
Yeah, you wanna keep it like this?

00:56.119 --> 00:56.419
Yeah.

00:56.539 --> 00:57.059
Like blue.

00:57.099 --> 00:58.979
Both of our eyes are blue, look at that.

00:59.100 --> 00:59.520
Oh yeah.

00:59.620 --> 01:00.200
Yeah, it fits.

01:01.060 --> 01:01.480
Nice.

01:03.681 --> 01:04.721
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

01:05.361 --> 01:06.181
It's not even lagging.

01:06.521 --> 01:07.522
No, I think it's fine.

01:07.802 --> 01:09.202
We can move this over if you want to.

01:09.402 --> 01:10.162
Oh, alright.

01:10.202 --> 01:11.082
It's kind of hard to move.

01:14.672 --> 01:15.293
Let's gooo

01:15.513 --> 01:16.894
That's better now you look at chat

01:16.994 --> 01:17.615
Let's goo...

01:17.635 --> 01:18.315
Is it better?

01:18.335 --> 01:19.136
Oh, it's...

01:19.276 --> 01:20.157
Like, that's better

01:20.737 --> 01:21.117
Uh...

01:21.338 --> 01:22.298
Something like this is probably...

01:22.398 --> 01:23.720
Yeah, this is probably better

01:24.220 --> 01:26.041
Okay, so we're watching, um...

01:27.262 --> 01:28.964
Ollie's tournament, and...

01:28.984 --> 01:30.565
I don't really know what's happening, to be honest

01:32.727 --> 01:33.628
We're literally...

01:33.808 --> 01:35.389
We're literally just like viewers

01:35.469 --> 01:36.770
It's just like you guys.

01:39.154 --> 01:41.894
Uh, we have a few different views here.

01:41.914 --> 01:43.995
Okay, so I think Ollie...

01:44.295 --> 01:46.295
Is there spectator mode for this? I guess so.

01:46.595 --> 01:47.535
I guess so. Oh, wait wait.

01:48.196 --> 01:49.856
Uh, do you still have your BGM now, Nami?

01:50.276 --> 01:51.236
Oh yeah yeah, you can turn it off.

01:51.556 --> 01:51.816
Okay.

01:53.857 --> 01:55.197
My BGM now.

01:55.937 --> 01:57.518
And do you have a BGM you want me to play?

01:58.598 --> 02:00.118
Oh, I don't have it. My...

02:00.478 --> 02:00.818
My...

02:01.398 --> 02:06.440
You know what? My BGM, my viewers always say that it's like brainwashing, kind of?

02:06.460 --> 02:06.620
Aww.

02:07.840 --> 02:08.781
In a good way, right?

02:09.782 --> 02:11.283
I think so, yeah. In a good way, yeah.

02:12.383 --> 02:14.245
We'll just turn up...

02:14.265 --> 02:15.706
A little bit.

02:16.026 --> 02:17.046
Some of the background noise.

02:17.146 --> 02:20.369
Double check the...

02:20.409 --> 02:21.529
Try being fine, I think.

02:21.689 --> 02:23.250
Yeah, yeah.

02:23.350 --> 02:27.433
Okay, that's good.

02:27.513 --> 02:28.014
Oh, I see.

02:28.094 --> 02:28.494
Wow.

02:28.514 --> 02:30.995
Okay, I'm gonna grab some snacks.

02:31.075 --> 02:33.177
Yeah, we have some snacks that we're gonna try.

02:33.859 --> 02:40.063
Come on, Sean. Do you guys know, chat, do you guys know what is going on in the tournament right now?

02:42.785 --> 02:46.648
We're supposed to be the commentators and we asked Oli and she was like, yeah

02:48.530 --> 02:52.513
Please tell us. Hide and seek. Okay, they're doing the hide and seek event

02:54.775 --> 02:58.117
Um, yes, effects

02:58.277 --> 02:58.898
Oh, they're right here!

03:02.536 --> 03:09.200
I actually went around the room looking for the snacks and it's like literally right beside me

03:09.660 --> 03:12.241
That is the stupidest thing ever

03:12.301 --> 03:13.742
No, no, no, they're easy to pass over

03:13.922 --> 03:15.763
It's in a bag so it looks like it could be trash

03:17.424 --> 03:19.526
Oh yeah, we can chat about it now

03:19.546 --> 03:20.866
Zae Zae's in Japan

03:21.427 --> 03:24.569
Oh yeah, I'm in Japan, let's go

03:24.609 --> 03:26.229
Yeah, I saw on the pre-chat people were like

03:26.270 --> 03:28.791
Is Ame in Indoor Beach?

03:29.611 --> 03:30.252
What's going on?

03:31.854 --> 03:36.137
You're my heart, so that means you're technically, you know

03:36.157 --> 03:37.459
I wanna go one day though, that'd be cool

03:37.859 --> 03:39.780
Oh, that would be nice, yeah

03:39.860 --> 03:41.562
Oh, oh, is this mine?

03:41.582 --> 03:42.983
Yeah, it doesn't matter, we share

03:43.183 --> 03:44.904
But I'm not really a huge fan

03:44.924 --> 03:46.225
We have, um, pocky

03:46.766 --> 03:49.608
It's matcha chocolate pocky

03:50.609 --> 03:53.531
And we also have these little burger buns

03:53.811 --> 03:55.373
It looks like we have chocolate in the middle,

03:55.393 --> 03:56.453
but actually I don't know.

03:57.296 --> 03:59.857
It doesn't... I don't know, is this like...

04:00.217 --> 04:02.218
I don't know, it looks like burger wannabe

04:02.358 --> 04:04.680
Yeah, it's super cute though, it looks like a burger

04:04.700 --> 04:05.620
But I think it's chocolate

04:05.640 --> 04:08.522
Yeah, how do I explain this?

04:08.542 --> 04:09.522
This one is like...

04:10.343 --> 04:13.444
It looks like the burger is about like the size of a...

04:15.265 --> 04:18.167
A gumball?

04:18.427 --> 04:18.647
Yeah

04:18.807 --> 04:19.748
I'd like a gumball, yeah.

04:28.345 --> 04:29.945
Oh, what? Taking someone out?

04:30.466 --> 04:33.307
Choco anpan.

04:33.447 --> 04:34.947
Choco anpan? Okay.

04:35.848 --> 04:36.548
I can read.

04:36.588 --> 04:37.708
Yeah, I can read.

04:37.788 --> 04:38.349
I can read.

04:38.789 --> 04:39.749
I can read.

04:40.109 --> 04:41.770
I can, but only if I try.

04:43.711 --> 04:44.811
We have to try.

04:45.291 --> 04:46.372
We are here after all.

04:46.392 --> 04:48.512
We also have chips with butter and seaweed.

04:48.612 --> 04:50.053
And table chips.

04:50.513 --> 04:51.273
Interesting.

04:51.433 --> 04:55.175
I love how we're talking about chips and there's like people screaming in the back.

04:55.575 --> 04:56.775
Whoa, whoa, no!

04:59.983 --> 05:01.303
Yeah, I can't really see...

05:01.323 --> 05:04.364
It looks like there's 12 people left right now in the tournament.

05:04.504 --> 05:07.104
Wait, let me see. Yeah, there's like 12 people.

05:07.124 --> 05:10.985
Wow, we have two of the same perspectives. Maybe I should change...

05:12.246 --> 05:13.406
Somebody else's perspective.

05:13.506 --> 05:14.326
Oh, we could try.

05:14.346 --> 05:17.027
Oh, do you wanna, like, unhide first?

05:17.207 --> 05:17.867
Oh, it's fine.

05:17.947 --> 05:18.847
Okay, I think it's okay.

05:19.327 --> 05:20.127
There we go.

05:20.288 --> 05:21.028
Nenechi!

05:21.048 --> 05:23.828
Nenechi! Nene-chan-bai!

05:24.308 --> 05:25.989
Ah, so, and we also have pineapple.

05:26.049 --> 05:27.189
Nice healthy snack.

05:27.249 --> 05:27.669
Yeah.

05:28.269 --> 05:29.510
Oh yeah, that one is healthy.

05:30.446 --> 05:33.688
What do you want to dig into first? Salty?

05:34.028 --> 05:34.428
Sweet?

05:34.769 --> 05:35.769
Or no, salty, sweet?

05:36.229 --> 05:37.570
Hell... This is sweet as well

05:37.770 --> 05:40.732
Sweet, salty

05:41.492 --> 05:43.793
This is... like savory maybe?

05:43.813 --> 05:45.214
Yeah, this is savory sweet

05:45.254 --> 05:47.756
It's the pocky

05:47.776 --> 05:49.436
This one is salty, definitely

05:50.097 --> 05:52.878
We'll eat salty from here, maybe

05:53.098 --> 05:55.720
I kinda wanna try this one

05:56.100 --> 05:57.221
The burgers!

05:57.441 --> 05:58.161
The burgers!

05:58.201 --> 05:58.922
Chocolate burgers!

05:58.942 --> 06:00.062
It's the burger.

06:00.383 --> 06:02.604
We can answer some questions while watching and snacking

06:02.624 --> 06:04.784
We're multi-task geniuses

06:04.804 --> 06:07.765
Oh, wait, we forgot to turn off...

06:08.145 --> 06:09.265
Play Black Spam

06:09.285 --> 06:12.086
Which one? Oh, the thing that makes it...

06:12.286 --> 06:13.586
The DVR thingy

06:14.206 --> 06:15.407
Can we turn it off?

06:15.467 --> 06:17.807
I think we can do it like mid, and...

06:18.507 --> 06:23.188
Which one? Is it here?

06:23.708 --> 06:25.449
Oh, we can turn it off! Nice!

06:25.729 --> 06:27.849
Yeah, maybe he refresh chat

06:27.869 --> 06:28.509
Maybe yeah

06:31.494 --> 06:32.635
Do it by yourself

06:33.975 --> 06:37.797
I say that and I have like so I have like oh my setting up my screen for me

06:37.817 --> 06:39.737
These are cute

06:40.938 --> 06:46.480
Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, this one's cute. Yeah

06:46.520 --> 06:52.962
She's camping hiding. Well, this hide and seek so that makes sense. I mean, I guess you could say this one is hide and seek

06:53.282 --> 06:55.023
Yeah, yeah

06:55.123 --> 06:57.324
That's a good spot. I've never seen that spot before

06:57.364 --> 07:00.985
Yeah, under the house, a little after, sort of, I guess.

07:01.806 --> 07:03.667
And so, is it like...

07:03.707 --> 07:08.088
What's half of the people? Half of the players versus like half of the players or something?

07:08.128 --> 07:10.929
Or is it like, maybe three people? One team is it, maybe?

07:10.969 --> 07:14.970
She posted them somewhere, right?

07:15.070 --> 07:16.131
Yeah, yeah.

07:16.371 --> 07:17.951
A couple of these rules.

07:18.051 --> 07:18.791
Bey is on the hunt.

07:18.832 --> 07:21.192
She's hunting, she's hunting, she's looking!

07:31.749 --> 07:35.070
It's Bae, Muna, and Toa as the hunters.

07:36.351 --> 07:37.591
The ones who are in...

07:39.612 --> 07:41.093
Is Muna not opening PLV?

07:44.334 --> 07:46.055
Is she streaming her PLV? Does anybody know?

07:48.176 --> 07:50.117
I can open it if we have it. I mean, if she's...

07:51.337 --> 07:53.398
Are you sure that Ollie is in the commentator?

07:55.819 --> 07:58.341
I think Ollie does a better commentary.

07:58.381 --> 08:00.061
We're just reacting we're reacting

08:00.322 --> 08:02.503
Seekers

08:04.364 --> 08:05.544
Seekers?

08:05.644 --> 08:09.346
Seekers are not allowed to use legends who can look at players, see their bloodhounds

08:09.626 --> 08:15.068
They will have to wait 5 minutes to let the players hide once they find the people who are hidden

08:15.108 --> 08:16.568
They will have to kill them

08:16.588 --> 08:19.829
Time limit after the hiding count is 15 minutes

08:19.869 --> 08:20.189
15 minutes?

08:21.630 --> 08:24.131
Hiders! They hide somewhere outside the swamp area

08:24.191 --> 08:24.951
Walls needed

08:24.991 --> 08:28.172
They are not allowed to spoil others hiding stuff

08:28.272 --> 08:30.353
Okay, that's pretty basic rules for the hiders

08:30.373 --> 08:31.694
Yeah, it's kind of basic.

08:31.214 --> 08:33.316
Outside of the swamp.

08:33.356 --> 08:36.959
I don't think they really found that many people.

08:37.320 --> 08:40.963
It only says they found someone.

08:41.403 --> 08:41.703
I think.

08:41.723 --> 08:47.929
Oh my god.

08:47.969 --> 08:49.470
They found two of them under the bridge.

08:50.271 --> 08:51.032
Oh no!

08:51.632 --> 08:54.014
I feel like a lot of people are hiding under the map in this part.

08:54.315 --> 08:55.255
They can move, right?

08:56.438 --> 08:59.099
I don't know. Can they? Maybe not. I don't think it's part of the rules.

08:59.780 --> 09:04.222
Oh, like, oh, you're just like, you pick a place to hide and then, like, you can't go anywhere.

09:04.242 --> 09:05.363
I guess you're doomed there.

09:05.883 --> 09:10.566
Yeah. Oh, I see. No, you can't move after the five minutes of the hiding trap.

09:10.626 --> 09:13.188
Oh, I see, I see.

09:13.228 --> 09:15.369
Oh, somebody picked a spot on the edge of the map.

09:15.409 --> 09:16.910
That'd be really ballsy.

09:16.930 --> 09:18.411
Everyone is saying Bana.

09:18.431 --> 09:18.511
Anna?

09:25.736 --> 09:28.037
That was fallen and that was gone

09:28.077 --> 09:29.378
And like, all the shack

09:29.398 --> 09:31.138
She was under the bridge

09:31.198 --> 09:31.639
Grandpa

09:31.659 --> 09:32.959
Oh, oh, there's another one

09:33.019 --> 09:33.620
Double cock

09:33.740 --> 09:35.180
Double cock is gone

09:35.220 --> 09:36.401
What'd you think of these...

09:38.081 --> 09:38.542
Burger things?

09:38.562 --> 09:41.423
They're just chocolate balls

09:41.483 --> 09:41.763
Yay!

09:52.833 --> 09:56.655
I'm like, I'm dying

09:56.735 --> 09:59.517
Oh but, but this, this one

09:59.578 --> 10:02.119
I like the effort

10:02.219 --> 10:07.383
They taste, the bread kinda seems like stale, almost

10:07.423 --> 10:09.765
Like, it's kinda stiff

10:09.785 --> 10:12.207
But the taste is nice, nice chocolate taste

10:12.547 --> 10:15.369
I don't think there were meant to be breads, I guess

10:15.389 --> 10:16.590
they were just meant to be like

10:23.166 --> 10:25.047
I squished it to see how hard it is

10:26.847 --> 10:32.229
Oh, I'll get some little forks for this too

10:32.430 --> 10:33.350
Okay

10:34.630 --> 10:36.771
Come back soon, I can't commentate

10:36.951 --> 10:40.733
Hello, we gotta do professional commentary

10:41.573 --> 10:43.954
We gotta do professional commentary

10:43.974 --> 10:45.134
Oh no, she's gone

10:45.174 --> 10:45.775
She's gone, Chad.

10:51.057 --> 10:52.838
She's literally looking at a yoke.

10:53.618 --> 10:54.098
No, I think...

10:54.498 --> 10:55.398
Oh, it's the pipe.

10:56.119 --> 10:56.899
Where is she?

10:58.399 --> 10:59.720
I literally don't know where this...

11:00.160 --> 11:01.920
I mean, we can see it in the map.

11:01.980 --> 11:02.820
Oh, thank you!

11:02.840 --> 11:03.040
You know

11:14.304 --> 11:15.324
The dinosaur?

11:15.364 --> 11:16.204
Yeah, the dinosaur

11:16.224 --> 11:19.325
Since when does it have that long legs?

11:19.725 --> 11:20.945
I think always

11:20.965 --> 11:24.346
It moves?

11:24.826 --> 11:26.167
Yeah, yeah, you never noticed?

11:26.527 --> 11:26.847
No

11:26.867 --> 11:29.828
I guess I've never seen it up close

11:29.868 --> 11:32.088
I've always seen, like, from, like...

11:32.128 --> 11:32.508
Yeah

11:32.588 --> 11:33.789
On top of a hill or something

11:33.869 --> 11:35.629
It's kind of hard to see them move from far away

11:35.649 --> 11:37.990
I don't think they actually move when you're far away

11:38.010 --> 11:40.510
And I do understand about Jack

11:42.448 --> 11:45.769
I've been looking at the chat, it's terrifying

11:45.869 --> 11:46.329
Why?

11:46.349 --> 11:46.409
Why?

11:46.969 --> 11:48.250
Why is it terrifying?

11:48.290 --> 11:48.950
I'm scared

11:48.970 --> 11:49.850
You're scared

11:49.870 --> 11:50.710
Scared

11:50.911 --> 11:52.491
I'm gonna crack down or whatever

11:52.531 --> 11:54.332
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is the share

11:54.352 --> 11:57.213
I actually don't eat fruit

11:57.293 --> 11:57.413
Huh?

11:57.473 --> 11:59.033
Yeah, you're making me eat fruit

11:59.113 --> 11:59.754
Which is good

12:00.074 --> 12:00.674
It's so good

12:01.514 --> 12:04.135
What do you mean you don't eat fruit?

12:04.715 --> 12:05.616
They're too sweet

12:06.936 --> 12:08.257
Is it sweet?

12:10.217 --> 12:11.338
Oh, it's super sweet

12:11.598 --> 12:12.178
It's so sweet.

12:14.140 --> 12:16.760
You don't like candy? Because it's sweet too?

12:19.021 --> 12:20.282
I don't want candy as well.

12:20.302 --> 12:22.363
I actually don't like chocolate that much.

12:22.383 --> 12:24.443
You don't? Yeah.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.324
I'm not a huge fan of candy either.

12:26.344 --> 12:27.865
I think it's Wookie's, oh my god.

12:29.245 --> 12:31.186
I have Wookie's and die up here.

12:31.286 --> 12:32.066
One of these.

12:34.407 --> 12:34.887
Loading.

12:34.907 --> 12:37.208
I think it's catching up.

12:37.228 --> 12:38.468
It's floating, it's floating!

12:43.581 --> 12:48.363
It looks like there's five or no a few people left. I can't really tell

12:48.483 --> 12:53.146
Um, five five five five people left in the hide-and-seek

12:54.226 --> 12:57.128
And could you not participate because you were traveling also

12:58.508 --> 13:05.212
Yeah, originally I had something scheduled like when it was happening so

13:05.952 --> 13:11.235
But I realized like maybe I could have joined, you know, definitely.

13:13.518 --> 13:16.200
Yeah, we can react. This is good, it's good.

13:16.340 --> 13:19.302
And eat burgers.

13:19.342 --> 13:20.643
Chocolate, yeah, chocolate burgers.

13:20.683 --> 13:21.604
Fake burgers.

13:23.065 --> 13:23.465
Chip time.

13:23.525 --> 13:23.805
Chips.

13:23.906 --> 13:26.928
I wonder how do you say chips in Japanese.

13:26.968 --> 13:27.148
Chip.

13:27.168 --> 13:30.811
Actually, I don't have a chat.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.468
Nice!

13:52.589 --> 13:54.709
Let's go!

13:54.769 --> 13:55.790
So strong!

13:56.890 --> 13:57.551
There you go.

13:57.631 --> 13:58.051
Ah, thank you.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.452
Wow, these potato chips are thick.

14:00.672 --> 14:02.353
Ah, they're flying into different...

14:02.633 --> 14:05.674
I wonder if, like, the map is, you know, sectioned off.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.056
Maybe they just want to use their ult for fun.

14:10.937 --> 14:11.917
Or they're trying to...

14:12.757 --> 14:13.998
They're trying to play it, you know.

14:14.018 --> 14:16.199
Trying to play it risky.

14:16.779 --> 14:19.140
Ah, these are so strong, the flavor.

14:19.260 --> 14:19.400
Oh!

14:19.700 --> 14:20.461
Oh, no!

14:22.583 --> 14:23.903
Oh, they found someone in a cliff?

14:23.943 --> 14:26.785
Maybe they're thinking of like hiding spots

14:26.945 --> 14:27.405
Who is it?

14:27.765 --> 14:29.827
Who's the race?

14:29.847 --> 14:30.607
That was a really good spot

14:30.627 --> 14:31.487
That's a good spot

14:31.507 --> 14:32.448
That's a good spot

14:32.528 --> 14:33.448
And then...

14:33.469 --> 14:33.809
Kobo?

14:33.849 --> 14:34.149
Come on!

14:50.459 --> 14:52.379
I'm gonna check the room, I'm gonna check the room

14:52.859 --> 14:54.039
It's actually a really good spot

14:54.720 --> 14:56.020
That is actually a good spot, yeah

14:56.240 --> 14:58.540
I guess that's why they had to fly

14:58.560 --> 14:59.261
They couldn't climb

14:59.961 --> 15:00.821
She must have landed there

15:00.841 --> 15:03.401
But they jumped

15:04.342 --> 15:05.882
Isn't using blocks old?

15:05.982 --> 15:08.302
Kind of like

15:08.863 --> 15:10.943
You get to see everyone's location then

15:11.563 --> 15:14.324
Is Vocal out?

15:14.344 --> 15:16.644
But I don't think it shows people through walls, does it chat?

15:16.664 --> 15:18.125
I mean you get a higher vantage point

15:18.145 --> 15:19.545
a higher vantage point, but.

15:20.226 --> 15:21.307
We can't move right now?

15:21.607 --> 15:23.228
It's not allowed, it says.

15:23.248 --> 15:25.050
They removed the scan.

15:25.370 --> 15:26.711
Oh, they removed the scan.

15:26.731 --> 15:30.574
Ah, I was like, wait, what?

15:30.955 --> 15:32.216
They can just like, see the...

15:33.577 --> 15:35.238
Like, everyone's position then.

15:35.739 --> 15:37.340
The match is over either way.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.682
I guess they didn't find everybody in the 15 minutes, huh?

15:41.603 --> 15:45.487
What do you think of the butter chips?

15:46.487 --> 15:47.148
It's huge!

15:47.650 --> 15:53.593
huge yeah the size the chips are pretty big yeah it's kind of thick for some reason i thought it

15:53.633 --> 15:59.917
would be like more yeah yeah i feel like the thinner chips better than the thick chips

16:01.097 --> 16:05.800
oh that's a tough one do you like do you like the wavy one i like wavy the you one

16:05.900 --> 16:06.861
I think I like the wavy one better

16:06.881 --> 16:07.701
Okay, not a thing

16:08.121 --> 16:11.363
Oh, I like the way they remind me to enjoy it.

16:15.807 --> 16:20.209
I had a...we had these chips where they're like giant puffed

16:20.269 --> 16:21.550
It's like, you know Cheeto

16:21.570 --> 16:21.970
Oh yeah

16:22.050 --> 16:23.531
But it's like this big, it's huge

16:23.671 --> 16:28.214
And they were caramel flavoured, it's tasty

16:28.294 --> 16:30.155
Oh, they're all in Discord together, I think

16:30.615 --> 16:32.276
Is that Callie? I thought I heard Callie

16:32.296 --> 16:34.718
Do you think we can make the sound bigger?

16:34.738 --> 16:35.118
Yeah, yeah

16:35.218 --> 16:35.979
I'll turn up Ollie's volume.

16:46.327 --> 16:48.731
They want to find you, Kayla. Where were you hiding?

16:49.412 --> 16:52.397
You know what? Actually, Noah-sama killed two people besides me.

16:52.958 --> 16:53.559
and then like

17:05.645 --> 17:06.887
What?

17:07.568 --> 17:07.928
What?

17:08.268 --> 17:10.792
Wait, she's mine

17:10.852 --> 17:11.833
Your fork or mine?

17:11.853 --> 17:12.233
Your fork

17:12.253 --> 17:14.416
The kite luck is real

17:14.536 --> 17:15.057
Find me

17:15.077 --> 17:15.738
Did she win?

17:15.958 --> 17:16.839
She was in taiwan

17:16.859 --> 17:17.480
Where is she?

17:17.520 --> 17:18.461
Find me

17:18.561 --> 17:19.763
We love you all so much.

17:20.927 --> 17:21.247
What?

17:21.748 --> 17:22.288
Come on, come on.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.389
It's an audio balance, okay?

17:23.409 --> 17:23.530
Okay.

17:23.550 --> 17:23.670
Okay.

17:23.750 --> 17:24.170
Okay, what armor?

17:24.190 --> 17:24.551
This is me.

17:24.571 --> 17:24.651
Hi.

17:24.671 --> 17:25.211
This is me, Manna.

17:25.231 --> 17:25.512
Manna!

17:25.572 --> 17:25.932
Open air!

17:25.992 --> 17:26.653
I'm open air.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.294
Hello?

17:27.374 --> 17:27.634
Manna?

17:27.674 --> 17:28.735
The dinosaur?

17:28.795 --> 17:29.216
Manna?

17:29.236 --> 17:29.356
What?

17:29.376 --> 17:29.516
What?

17:29.556 --> 17:29.676
What?

17:29.696 --> 17:29.796
What?

17:29.816 --> 17:29.896
What?

17:29.916 --> 17:30.017
What?

17:30.037 --> 17:30.117
What?

17:30.137 --> 17:30.237
What?

17:30.257 --> 17:30.337
What?

17:30.357 --> 17:30.477
What?

17:41.531 --> 17:45.252
Oh my god, I was like...

17:45.392 --> 17:47.372
I would be like, that's the audio.

17:47.452 --> 17:48.573
Never mind, I don't care.

17:48.593 --> 17:50.393
You adjust your volume by yourself.

17:51.733 --> 17:52.553
Is that true?

17:52.613 --> 17:55.574
Yeah, I'll see you guys.

17:55.634 --> 17:57.855
Okay, okay.

17:57.875 --> 17:59.735
No one is too loud. No, you're too low now.

17:59.795 --> 18:01.095
Alright, I'm just gonna fix it.

18:01.115 --> 18:02.196
We didn't see it.

18:02.216 --> 18:03.676
Can I really hear both of them?

18:03.736 --> 18:06.697
I'll just turn it down for them and turn it up for us.

18:06.917 --> 18:07.097
Okay.

18:07.217 --> 18:09.839
Okay, this should be good, I think

18:10.340 --> 18:11.500
Should be fine, thank you

18:11.641 --> 18:12.641
We're a beast

18:12.661 --> 18:12.821
No

18:12.922 --> 18:13.182
No?

18:13.242 --> 18:17.185
This here, I don't know if it's mine or yours

18:17.245 --> 18:20.227
I didn't know it might be mine

18:20.247 --> 18:21.728
Do we have like two store for it later?

18:21.748 --> 18:22.489
Yeah, I think so.

18:35.640 --> 18:36.120
I ate one

18:36.140 --> 18:38.581
No, it must have fallen

18:38.822 --> 18:39.762
It's okay, I'll just grab it

18:39.862 --> 18:40.823
Oh, wait, it's in the bag

18:41.123 --> 18:41.563
They won't...

18:41.763 --> 18:42.603
I mean, I could've like...

18:42.744 --> 18:42.924
Oh

18:43.124 --> 18:47.126
What's going on?

18:51.648 --> 18:52.108
What's going on?

18:52.168 --> 18:52.809
What do you mean?

18:52.849 --> 18:53.709
What's going on?

18:54.450 --> 18:55.910
We're supposed to...

18:56.150 --> 18:57.171
No, we're reacting

18:57.271 --> 18:58.532
Oh, we're reacting, yeah

18:58.892 --> 19:01.473
Alright, looks like the match is over there

19:01.553 --> 19:02.534
Oh, it's game over

19:02.734 --> 19:03.274
Game over!

19:05.336 --> 19:08.058
The one! I guess the hider is the one

19:08.439 --> 19:08.879
Yeah

19:08.999 --> 19:09.739
It's really good

19:10.720 --> 19:13.822
Kylo won

19:13.842 --> 19:14.683
Joker has pineapple!

19:15.604 --> 19:15.944
Okay

19:20.527 --> 19:22.169
Is she like... Wait, Kylo won

19:22.209 --> 19:23.770
Is she like the hider or the secret?

19:23.790 --> 19:25.071
I think she was the one hiding

19:26.272 --> 19:28.313
Oh! She was the only one who wasn't found?

19:28.713 --> 19:29.074
Yeah

19:29.234 --> 19:30.034
That's insane

19:31.255 --> 19:31.676
Huzzah.

19:32.737 --> 19:34.498
Oh! Nice!

19:35.178 --> 19:37.399
I've actually never seen this Apex, where it's like the...

19:37.959 --> 19:38.660
A custom...

19:39.720 --> 19:40.881
Like, game lobby?

19:40.981 --> 19:41.761
Oh, yeah, custom...

19:42.081 --> 19:43.922
Have you ever made a custom game lobby?

19:44.102 --> 19:45.823
Nah, I thought it was limited to like...

19:46.243 --> 19:48.604
Only certain players for events, but I think...

19:48.984 --> 19:50.965
I guess I recently opened it up for everyone, huh?

19:51.785 --> 19:52.485
They want some!

19:53.826 --> 19:54.626
Or maybe like...

19:54.766 --> 19:56.106
Oh, you have special permissions!

19:56.127 --> 19:58.127
Yeah, maybe she has special permissions!

19:58.147 --> 20:00.648
I think the chat will know.

20:03.825 --> 20:05.706
Yeah, they changed it

20:05.906 --> 20:08.346
Yeah, this is what we're talking about

20:08.366 --> 20:10.327
It's for everyone now, this season, apparently

20:10.347 --> 20:10.827
This is really fun

20:11.387 --> 20:11.667
Let's see

20:11.707 --> 20:12.407
Let's see, let's see

20:12.427 --> 20:12.987
I love pineapple.

20:33.231 --> 20:34.651
How many rounds, I wonder?

20:35.292 --> 20:36.612
I think they're doing a different game mode now.

20:37.172 --> 20:37.392
Right?

20:38.593 --> 20:39.373
Oh, we have the...

20:39.753 --> 20:41.274
Oh, we have the info.

20:42.014 --> 20:43.075
We have info.

20:50.018 --> 20:50.738
Making the teams.

20:52.279 --> 20:55.660
Zombie raid, hide and seek, boxing match.

20:56.080 --> 20:56.580
Boxing?

20:57.201 --> 20:57.861
That sounds like fun.

20:59.742 --> 21:00.622
Look at their game rules.

21:01.242 --> 21:01.762
No rules.

21:02.364 --> 21:05.205
I think that'll probably be the last one, I think

21:05.325 --> 21:06.605
Yeah, they were like, you know...

21:06.805 --> 21:09.086
You know like, for like every game event

21:09.146 --> 21:11.767
They ended with like a happy note of people killing each other?

21:11.787 --> 21:11.867
Whoa

21:13.868 --> 21:14.728
That happened at every event?

21:14.748 --> 21:17.129
Oh, yeah, that's true, that's true

21:17.629 --> 21:18.109
Yeah

21:18.449 --> 21:18.650
Like...

21:20.330 --> 21:21.311
Oh, two!

21:22.411 --> 21:23.391
Oh, two, now die!

21:23.411 --> 21:29.193
Are we back?

21:29.253 --> 21:30.374
and then we had a little lag.

21:31.435 --> 21:32.396
Oh, did we die?

21:32.416 --> 21:39.681
It should be okay though, right?

21:43.583 --> 21:45.624
Okay, we're back. Okay, let's go.

21:45.644 --> 21:45.845
We're back.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.206
We're back. We're back.

21:49.147 --> 21:49.567
Yay.

21:50.307 --> 21:51.988
No way, nothing happened while we're back.

21:52.329 --> 21:53.189
We ate two chips.

21:53.590 --> 21:55.671
1 fruit, that's Zeta 8 to choose

21:56.637 --> 21:59.718
No, no, no, I'm gonna have some, I'm gonna have some

21:59.958 --> 22:01.079
I'm just... I'm a fruit addict

22:02.619 --> 22:03.780
That's pretty good, actually

22:04.240 --> 22:06.361
Yeah, it's nice cuz it comes, like, pre-cut

22:06.401 --> 22:08.161
You can get it from the konbini here

22:08.722 --> 22:10.562
They have, like, different fruit that you can get, it's so good

22:10.582 --> 22:11.583
And it stays cold

22:11.603 --> 22:12.123
Mmm, that's so good

22:12.163 --> 22:13.323
It's cold, chat

22:13.343 --> 22:14.584
You can have the last one if you want

22:14.604 --> 22:18.405
Oh, can I?

22:18.425 --> 22:18.605
Mm-hmm.

22:18.625 --> 22:18.765
all.

22:18.785 --> 22:20.906
So, that's it for this week's show.

22:20.926 --> 22:22.266
I hope you enjoyed it.

22:22.346 --> 22:24.147
And if you did, please like and subscribe.

22:24.167 --> 22:26.248
I'll see you all next time.

22:25.748 --> 22:29.670
Eating a fruit for the first time in one year

22:29.850 --> 22:30.190
What?

22:30.210 --> 22:32.071
Yeah, no

22:32.571 --> 22:32.951
Yes

22:34.291 --> 22:35.212
I'm not even kidding

22:35.552 --> 22:37.733
Why? You need fruit, you're gonna get scurvy

22:37.753 --> 22:38.973
Do you know what that is?

22:39.353 --> 22:41.374
I don't know when I get it

22:41.394 --> 22:47.696
You're gonna be like a pirate

22:48.657 --> 22:53.078
mmm it's good for you, it's tasty

22:54.800 --> 22:56.481
This is good. This is actually good.

22:57.061 --> 22:58.261
I might buy it on my own.

22:59.542 --> 23:00.562
Yatta! Yatta!

23:02.603 --> 23:05.405
Pineapple has a lot of beneficial nutrients.

23:06.165 --> 23:07.886
Oh, it died again. I wonder why.

23:08.206 --> 23:09.326
Ah, it's seated in here.

23:10.247 --> 23:11.647
Oh, it's fine then. Doesn't matter.

23:12.168 --> 23:15.069
Look at the... I can't...

23:16.129 --> 23:17.470
Bey's octane.

23:18.310 --> 23:20.251
Her octane skin though.

23:21.272 --> 23:22.612
Not bald, Rhys!

23:22.954 --> 23:29.376
I'm not really sure what's going on with the teams

23:29.536 --> 23:31.957
Oh, zombies, zombies, zombies

23:32.377 --> 23:34.538
Ah, zombies, I see, okay

23:35.019 --> 23:37.780
But they are not allowed to use any looting items

23:37.800 --> 23:41.221
The only looting items that they are allowed to use is the one that they start off

23:41.261 --> 23:42.902
The two 12 and the 13

23:43.702 --> 23:45.083
Ask for the...

23:45.123 --> 23:48.204
No looting items

23:48.624 --> 23:51.606
They will loot for 5 minutes in their home-mated areas?

23:53.827 --> 23:55.589
And after that, they will just have to survive

23:55.629 --> 23:59.471
There will be rings, there will be 20 minutes max

23:59.511 --> 24:00.212
20 minutes max

24:00.912 --> 24:03.534
Yeah, 20 minutes, yeah

24:03.554 --> 24:05.255
I guess the people who are a single team

24:05.295 --> 24:06.696
So good as a zombie

24:07.517 --> 24:08.037
Oh, who's this?

24:08.978 --> 24:09.598
I can't see

24:09.618 --> 24:11.239
No!

24:11.860 --> 24:13.120
Ollie, why?

24:14.161 --> 24:15.442
Let us see

24:15.462 --> 24:15.502
Eh?

24:16.483 --> 24:17.984
Oh, I think we're restarting the game

24:18.044 --> 24:19.585
Probably something happened with the teams

24:19.845 --> 24:20.125
Okay

24:20.485 --> 24:22.107
Good as a hunter, zombie.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.261
We don't have the hick emoji.

24:31.262 --> 24:33.223
What kind of establishment are you wearing?

24:35.405 --> 24:36.305
Restart.

24:37.626 --> 24:39.227
Restart.

24:39.848 --> 24:40.488
Restart.

24:40.508 --> 24:45.931
Oh yeah, I'm gonna take out the ice cream that I have too.

24:46.552 --> 24:48.233
Ice cream! Let's go!

24:48.253 --> 24:49.994
I wanted ice cream!

24:51.135 --> 24:52.656
Let's go, let's go.

24:52.796 --> 24:55.037
What flavor do you have on this?

24:56.039 --> 24:57.459
Dango

24:57.919 --> 24:59.399
You like mita shi dango?

24:59.719 --> 25:00.580
Oh no, I've never tried it

25:00.840 --> 25:01.480
You've never tried it?

25:01.660 --> 25:03.500
Nope, it's really tasty

25:03.520 --> 25:05.881
Like a sweet glaze of mochi

25:05.941 --> 25:06.721
And so...

25:07.241 --> 25:08.961
Ew, this one looks like egg yolk

25:09.201 --> 25:10.702
It's not, it's not egg yolk

25:10.842 --> 25:12.042
It is egg yolk

25:12.082 --> 25:13.502
This is brown, not yolk

25:13.542 --> 25:14.743
This is an egg

25:14.823 --> 25:16.403
And this is not a burger

25:16.423 --> 25:20.024
What is up with the food?

25:20.044 --> 25:22.104
And it's probably better if you want to eat it super cold

25:22.204 --> 25:24.085
Usually I like to let it defrost a little bit

25:24.805 --> 25:25.405
Oh, I'm eating now.

25:26.486 --> 25:27.667
There's two, so it's perfect

25:28.288 --> 25:29.208
Wait, what?

25:29.869 --> 25:30.710
Why is there two?

25:31.350 --> 25:32.111
There's a...

25:32.291 --> 25:33.472
They're like little mochi

25:33.492 --> 25:36.414
And then have ice cream and like sauce inside

25:36.434 --> 25:40.778
I can't open it

25:40.838 --> 25:41.459
I'm so sorry

25:41.479 --> 25:42.980
Slippery

25:43.000 --> 25:45.142
Slippery, slippery hands

25:45.162 --> 25:47.244
There's a little fork too

25:47.264 --> 25:49.165
It's too cold

25:49.185 --> 25:50.326
You gonna eat it like this?

25:50.867 --> 25:51.727
I can eat it like this

25:51.827 --> 25:52.408
Thank you.

25:54.591 --> 26:02.614
This is egg. It's not egg. It's egg. It literally looks like egg. Ew, what? It doesn't. It's mochi.

26:06.916 --> 26:14.480
The mochi is so tough. Because it's really cold. I'm gonna let mine defrost a little bit.

26:16.281 --> 26:19.402
Isn't this just like frozen burger? It's not a...

26:21.103 --> 26:22.084
I hope it looks cute.

26:22.104 --> 26:23.684
It looks cute though

26:24.725 --> 26:29.046
Yes, the mochi is like brown colored on the outside almost

26:29.106 --> 26:31.347
But it's kind of like white from being frozen

26:31.367 --> 26:33.667
What do you think?

26:33.687 --> 26:36.468
I think it has vanilla ice cream inside

26:36.488 --> 26:38.888
But I haven't gotten to the inside

26:40.048 --> 26:44.229
It's like a wrapped in mochi vanilla ice cream with sauce in the middle

26:44.269 --> 26:46.450
It's like a mitarashi dango sauce

26:48.230 --> 26:49.850
Oh, this is good. You like it?

26:50.750 --> 26:51.931
This almost feels like...

26:54.092 --> 26:56.974
Um, I don't... Yeah, it is... It is what it is

26:56.995 --> 26:57.915
This is good though

26:57.955 --> 26:59.396
Machi machi

27:00.477 --> 27:01.418
This is good though

27:01.518 --> 27:03.920
So it looks like we have... Is that Iris, maybe?

27:03.940 --> 27:05.261
I think that's Iris

27:05.401 --> 27:06.101
And then...

27:06.642 --> 27:07.642
In... Ina?

27:07.882 --> 27:08.363
Callie?

27:08.383 --> 27:12.606
And... I don't know, actually... Is this... Maybe Robocop?

27:13.106 --> 27:14.187
I can't see!

27:16.249 --> 27:18.810
Trying to figure out who's on the zombie side.

27:19.552 --> 27:24.394
Yeah, we're opening so many taps so the taps are small so we can't see the knees

27:26.655 --> 27:27.376
Maybe they'll know

27:30.157 --> 27:34.479
Maybe they want to eat my ice cream, but oh wait, I don't like the super hard ice cream

27:37.000 --> 27:39.541
This is pretty good another restart I think

27:40.782 --> 27:46.304
That's okay. We can wait forever. Yes. We're just snacking on stuff. So we got time we got time

27:47.284 --> 27:48.765
Burger eggs. No, no, no.

27:52.830 --> 28:03.693
It's a sauce. I'm not yet

28:03.733 --> 28:11.255
Needs more clickbait to be tubers react to vtubers

28:16.457 --> 28:20.378
pretty much is like mukbang stream i mean we don't have that much snacks

28:21.599 --> 28:24.000
Because we're eating livers

28:24.520 --> 28:26.360
Yeah, yeah, we don't want to get too many snacks

28:26.380 --> 28:27.321
Because we're going to have dinner

28:32.602 --> 28:34.102
But first, apex

28:35.183 --> 28:35.983
And there's the sauce

28:36.863 --> 28:37.943
Oh, it's this one!

28:38.363 --> 28:39.844
Tasty? This is good

28:40.624 --> 28:42.044
Yeah, it's super sweet though

28:44.965 --> 28:47.786
Maybe I'll sit on mine so it'll defrost faster.

28:50.167 --> 28:51.888
I defrosted with my spit

28:53.448 --> 28:54.508
That's true, actually

28:54.528 --> 28:56.689
Spit does help

29:00.630 --> 29:02.010
So I think they're probably having an issue

29:02.050 --> 29:03.211
Like, when they get into the game

29:03.231 --> 29:05.731
The game is, like, putting people into teams

29:05.751 --> 29:08.872
That they're not originally supposed to be part of or something

29:08.892 --> 29:10.732
That's why they keep restarting, I imagine

29:11.053 --> 29:13.213
I wonder if they have to restart again

29:13.473 --> 29:15.474
Like, the Game Master have to, like...

29:16.374 --> 29:17.094
I'm not too sure...

29:20.389 --> 29:25.152
it's okay take it easy take it easy take it easy we're just having fun

29:27.213 --> 29:30.976
i should have put i should have flipped the ears so that our ribbons could touch

29:30.996 --> 29:39.802
this is zeta's channel so uh i'm zeta

29:41.443 --> 29:45.626
Sorry, I ate so messily I wasn't looking, I'm not watching

29:46.328 --> 29:50.210
do you have a tissue oh yeah yeah i have it it's full of ice cream all over

29:50.230 --> 29:57.133
thank you

29:58.274 --> 30:01.436
now it seems difficult to eat because this is so squishy it is

30:01.836 --> 30:07.039
It kind of it kind of fell over like one side of like the it's like a popsicle. Yeah. Yeah

30:10.095 --> 30:12.596
Yeah, we're doing off-collab right now

30:12.836 --> 30:15.057
Oh yeah, everyone's still surprised about the off-collab

30:15.077 --> 30:16.277
That's why all the chat is like

30:16.518 --> 30:17.278
Oh, come on!

30:18.939 --> 30:20.239
It is sitting on my couch

30:21.420 --> 30:22.901
It's a pretty comfy couch, right?

30:22.941 --> 30:25.162
When you move, it kind of makes weird sounds though, but...

30:25.662 --> 30:27.222
Pretty comfy

30:29.504 --> 30:31.645
Better than my gamer chair, maybe

30:34.866 --> 30:35.806
Wait, that one, right?

30:36.327 --> 30:37.227
Yeah, that one's...

30:37.667 --> 30:38.368
And it's kind of comfy.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.580
Yeah, we'll get a chair

30:44.361 --> 30:46.161
Do you use one?

30:46.441 --> 30:47.721
I use one, I use one

30:50.002 --> 30:51.322
There's...probably better than...

30:51.962 --> 30:52.582
It's pretty good though

30:52.782 --> 30:53.863
I like the pillow in the back

30:54.583 --> 30:55.663
Yeah, the pillow...no...

30:55.703 --> 30:57.843
You need to have the pillows for your back

30:57.963 --> 31:01.544
Alright, looks like they're starting again

31:01.604 --> 31:02.744
Hopefully the team's...

31:02.804 --> 31:05.485
Hopefully, hopefully it'll work this time

31:05.545 --> 31:06.425
World's Edge

31:07.085 --> 31:07.605
Let's go

31:07.625 --> 31:10.086
You like this map better than the others?

31:10.966 --> 31:11.786
I feel like I have like one

31:13.488 --> 31:14.188
I think I like king

31:15.068 --> 31:17.050
Oh, king? King is also...

31:19.251 --> 31:20.472
Need that stick, can I have it?

31:21.192 --> 31:21.512
Oh, but...

31:22.012 --> 31:22.693
But it has my...

31:22.713 --> 31:24.754
My spit all over

31:24.774 --> 31:25.935
Okay, I'll use a fork

31:26.695 --> 31:29.297
I'll stab it

31:29.377 --> 31:31.358
Wait, I can wash it, I can wash it

31:31.378 --> 31:32.398
Oh, okay, okay

31:32.518 --> 31:33.959
I can wash it, we don't want...

31:34.119 --> 31:34.940
Personally, why?

31:34.960 --> 31:36.200
We don't want my spit all over

31:36.220 --> 31:36.901
Hold on

31:37.421 --> 31:38.222
Wash it

31:38.282 --> 31:40.123
He's washing the precious bit away, no!

31:41.985 --> 31:45.566
Let's try it. No, wait, I'll take it

31:45.946 --> 31:49.447
First time again, when I gotta adjust some stuff here

31:49.487 --> 31:49.707
What?

32:10.951 --> 32:11.351
Soap?

32:11.431 --> 32:11.771
It's soap

32:11.891 --> 32:12.572
Oh, it's soap

32:12.652 --> 32:13.812
Yeah, I was confused too

32:13.832 --> 32:15.453
The soap bottle

32:16.053 --> 32:16.753
I know, right?

32:19.694 --> 32:20.434
Yeah, yeah

32:20.454 --> 32:23.215
It looks like a spray paint can or something

32:23.235 --> 32:26.416
The dish soap here

32:26.596 --> 32:27.237
Looks weird

32:27.257 --> 32:35.859
Alright, it looks like they're landing

32:37.060 --> 32:39.481
And all the teams are proper this time

32:41.562 --> 32:43.523
Double glow senpai. Already looting.

32:43.543 --> 32:47.406
Getting her loot. I think you can get loot within the first five minutes.

32:47.446 --> 32:50.247
Yeah.

32:50.447 --> 32:51.968
Thank you.

32:52.408 --> 32:53.869
Oh, your nails are so pretty.

32:53.989 --> 32:54.829
Thank you.

32:54.850 --> 32:56.430
Thank you.

32:56.911 --> 32:57.951
What? Nail art.

32:58.111 --> 32:59.232
Yeah, you didn't?

32:59.252 --> 33:02.213
Oh, no, no. I didn't do it myself. I'm a mess.

33:03.614 --> 33:05.235
That's okay. My nails are super messed up.

33:06.896 --> 33:07.716
They're cute!

33:07.916 --> 33:08.877
What do you mean?

33:08.977 --> 33:10.918
I did it!

33:11.282 --> 33:14.564
I'm going to try this mochi, too.

33:15.444 --> 33:24.748
It's sweet.

33:26.269 --> 33:27.830
It is so sweet. It is so sweet.

33:27.930 --> 33:29.470
Especially the sauce in the middle.

33:29.490 --> 33:32.252
You know what I've seen?

33:32.292 --> 33:34.513
take like this type of emoji and I'll put it in

33:36.054 --> 33:36.695
Peppa Noodles

33:37.415 --> 33:39.756
They'll put it in the curry one and they'll put the vanilla

33:39.776 --> 33:41.937
Mochi ice cream in the curry

33:42.358 --> 33:43.318
What?

33:43.418 --> 33:45.079
And then they mix it up because it makes it creamy

33:45.359 --> 33:46.580
But it's dessert!

33:47.060 --> 33:49.501
How do you mix dessert with curry?

33:49.521 --> 33:52.022
Some people put like for Japanese curry they put like

33:52.263 --> 33:54.424
Slices of apples in it and make it like sweet

33:56.145 --> 33:56.965
No! Not apples!

33:56.985 --> 33:57.285
I mean...

33:57.405 --> 33:57.845
I mean...

34:05.486 --> 34:07.967
If it tastes good, it's sweet curry

34:08.247 --> 34:10.008
But you know, cause there's like coconut curry

34:10.048 --> 34:11.388
Coconuts, well, I don't know

34:11.448 --> 34:12.809
I guess coconut's not really that sweet

34:13.209 --> 34:14.009
Oh, coconut is...

34:14.610 --> 34:16.590
I feel like coconut would still, like...

34:17.511 --> 34:18.431
Fit, I don't know

34:18.691 --> 34:19.171
True shit

34:21.652 --> 34:22.312
Sweet curry

34:23.653 --> 34:25.914
Exactly, don't knock it till you try it

34:26.514 --> 34:27.895
Have you tried the curry here yet?

34:29.595 --> 34:30.736
Oh, not yet

34:30.876 --> 34:31.516
Not yet?

34:31.536 --> 34:32.976
Not yet, I've tried ramen

34:32.996 --> 34:33.517
Ooh

34:36.403 --> 34:39.505
I really like, uh, curry udon. You gotta try it.

34:40.466 --> 34:40.687
Ohhh!

34:41.247 --> 34:42.008
You can try it!

34:44.670 --> 34:46.552
There's so many! There's so many, like...

34:47.312 --> 34:48.413
Like, even when you look...

34:48.834 --> 34:51.516
Wanna, like, search for good ramen, it's everywhere!

34:51.536 --> 34:53.158
There's so many. There's so many.

35:00.564 --> 35:01.985
Oh, it sounds so sad. It's okay!

35:02.205 --> 35:03.126
It's okay, Ollie!

35:03.246 --> 35:04.947
It's fine! Don't worry!

35:05.087 --> 35:06.348
It happens, it happens!

35:06.428 --> 35:07.168
It's fine.

35:07.969 --> 35:08.569
It happens.

35:09.250 --> 35:12.772
Don't worry. The viewers are all chilling in here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

35:14.713 --> 35:15.493
Okay, that's everyone.

35:15.573 --> 35:16.714
Hi.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.697
No stress. Stress, stress, go away.

35:20.717 --> 35:22.018
It's your turn.

35:22.038 --> 35:23.218
Eat landlord's cake.

35:23.278 --> 35:23.899
Eat landlord's cake.

35:24.339 --> 35:25.620
Eat landlord's cake.

35:25.241 --> 35:26.402
Do you need help opening that?

35:26.862 --> 35:27.362
You got it.

35:27.802 --> 35:28.343
I got this.

35:28.923 --> 35:30.384
Give me one second.

35:32.085 --> 35:33.666
She's struggling with the box of Pocky.

35:34.907 --> 35:35.487
I believe!

35:35.507 --> 35:36.648
Oh, she's using tools.

35:36.668 --> 35:39.290
She's stabbing it with the fork.

35:39.750 --> 35:41.191
I'm using tools.

35:41.471 --> 35:43.132
And you didn't eat it anyways, did you?

35:43.713 --> 35:44.413
No, I didn't eat it.

35:44.593 --> 35:46.234
Okay, I have to explain myself.

35:46.294 --> 35:48.316
This is not a normal box of Pocky.

35:49.097 --> 35:52.698
This is a very strong box of Pocky

35:53.058 --> 35:53.918
This is different

35:53.938 --> 35:55.399
This is Japanese Pocky

35:55.439 --> 35:56.319
This is...

35:57.479 --> 35:59.320
You will not understand, Chan

35:59.620 --> 36:01.880
This is made of sturdy material

36:01.920 --> 36:04.061
Well, this is more of a sturdy Pocky box

36:04.121 --> 36:06.842
It's thick, damn

36:07.982 --> 36:08.782
Made of sturdy...

36:08.842 --> 36:10.703
No, actually this does feel like...

36:10.923 --> 36:13.083
This cardboard box does feel thicker for some reason

36:13.103 --> 36:14.404
Right, it does feel great.

36:14.504 --> 36:19.045
It must be cuz it's like a fancy texture cuz it's like matcha, paki

36:19.245 --> 36:25.127
No way, they kind of like packaged it in?

36:25.267 --> 36:26.827
Yeah, yeah, this is normal with paki

36:26.867 --> 36:28.748
They're like packaged in two different packs, I think

36:29.708 --> 36:30.989
Two different packs?

36:31.009 --> 36:32.789
Yeah, if you get the big box like this

36:32.809 --> 36:35.210
It's not really that big, actually

36:35.230 --> 36:36.770
I think it's normal

36:37.570 --> 36:38.191
I see

36:42.332 --> 36:46.335
I'm curious how it tastes cuz it says chocolate, but is it just like matcha chocolate?

36:47.876 --> 36:50.358
Matcha chocolate. Okay, let's let's let's see

36:50.438 --> 36:51.719
We'll really have to taste this

36:52.900 --> 36:53.460
Excuse me

36:53.720 --> 36:54.861
No problem!

36:55.442 --> 36:56.262
Pascaru!

36:56.282 --> 37:01.806
Yeah, cuz like cuz like in Indonesia at least Pocky only has like one one

37:02.266 --> 37:02.527
one

37:03.647 --> 37:05.609
I have cash, I guess.

37:08.291 --> 37:08.731
Ah, I see.

37:08.751 --> 37:10.813
Isn't it like a skinnier box? Oh, for me?

37:10.913 --> 37:12.194
Yeah, it is a skinnier box.

37:12.514 --> 37:17.058
Hence why I said that this is a different box, I'm telling you.

37:18.419 --> 37:19.319
This is a different box.

37:19.339 --> 37:21.962
We have to Kanpai our Pocky.

37:22.322 --> 37:23.863
Kanpai!

37:23.883 --> 37:30.728
Kanpai!

37:30.748 --> 37:32.129
This is not sweet at all.

37:32.269 --> 37:34.431
Mmm, it's got like a nice subtle flavor.

37:35.233 --> 37:36.114
Yeah, it's like...

37:36.614 --> 37:38.215
How do you... How do you say this?

37:38.795 --> 37:39.255
What... What's...

37:39.996 --> 37:41.216
What's like savory?

37:43.037 --> 37:43.758
What's savory?

37:43.798 --> 37:45.039
How do you explain savory?

37:45.699 --> 37:47.280
Uh, like mix your mouth water...

37:47.300 --> 37:48.180
Maybe?

37:50.221 --> 37:51.862
So it's not like a particular like...

37:51.922 --> 37:54.764
It's not like in the area of like salty sweet better...

37:55.644 --> 37:56.905
It's like kind of salty...

37:56.925 --> 37:58.086
It's like a balance, I think.

37:58.106 --> 38:00.027
A balance of...

38:00.487 --> 38:01.368
Somebody says umami.

38:01.668 --> 38:02.368
You know what umami?

38:02.948 --> 38:03.349
Umami.

38:03.689 --> 38:04.409
Umami, I know.

38:04.869 --> 38:05.270
Oh my man!

38:05.951 --> 38:11.275
Oh, umami. Umami sounds so cute. I like that word

38:12.997 --> 38:15.499
Umami flavor kind of reminds me of like meatballs

38:15.519 --> 38:30.771
This is good though, this is good though. You can you can taste like the shortbread the cookie. Yeah

38:30.871 --> 38:32.972
Yeah, this is great, this is great.

38:35.222 --> 38:35.982
Nice choice

38:37.903 --> 38:38.384
There was like...

38:38.784 --> 38:39.665
There was this one?

38:39.945 --> 38:40.685
Strawberry...

38:40.705 --> 38:45.408
Not too sure

38:48.250 --> 38:48.630
Oh no!

38:48.710 --> 38:49.591
It's fine, it's fine!

38:49.611 --> 38:50.592
That's what it is!

38:50.732 --> 38:51.232
That's what it is!

38:51.272 --> 38:58.697
why are urea taking complementary actions

38:58.837 --> 38:59.838
why are ure taking RAM

38:59.898 --> 39:00.398
why are u two

39:00.458 --> 39:00.718
why r�

39:00.738 --> 39:01.139
why wut

39:01.179 --> 39:01.319
why!!!!

39:01.359 --> 39:01.619
whyARD

39:04.757 --> 39:08.538
We're playing...well, we're not playing Apex. We're watching Apex.

39:08.578 --> 39:09.458
Yeah, we're busy.

39:09.938 --> 39:10.939
We're busy.

39:10.959 --> 39:12.299
What am I about to say, Kaha?

39:12.339 --> 39:14.780
We're two VTubers making a living, okay?

39:17.581 --> 39:19.602
It's what the people want.

39:19.842 --> 39:21.102
It's what the people want.

39:21.262 --> 39:22.703
Maybe after we drink a little or something.

39:22.823 --> 39:23.803
I'm just kidding.

39:23.823 --> 39:25.324
We'll see.

39:30.406 --> 39:32.047
We gotta save the poolkeeper later, then

39:32.067 --> 39:33.587
Woah!

39:33.667 --> 39:34.808
I should take it seriously

39:35.288 --> 39:36.369
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding

39:36.549 --> 39:37.689
I'm kidding as well

39:37.769 --> 39:38.930
I'm kidding as well

39:38.950 --> 39:40.591
Alright, we're going to fight again

39:40.611 --> 39:46.334
I'm probably going to win the least side

39:46.914 --> 39:51.176
I'm not exactly sure, chat, do you guys know what the problem could be?

39:51.196 --> 39:54.798
I think it is that the game's like putting players

39:54.938 --> 39:56.659
different themes probably.

40:02.544 --> 40:06.306
Don't worry, it's okay! No worries!

40:10.829 --> 40:14.872
Oh, someone died? Oh no

40:14.892 --> 40:16.193
Did they fall off the map? Maybe

40:16.213 --> 40:19.375
How is that possible? A bug?

40:20.436 --> 40:21.156
Don't quit me.

40:24.820 --> 40:32.421
It's very, very fast. I understand that when, uh, Sabrina, when you run out of time, the game kinda outtakes for you, sometimes it's randomized.

40:33.862 --> 40:36.462
Oh my, it's okay.

40:36.542 --> 40:41.383
I'm gonna choose big mochi thing, so I won't be able to speak for like a minute.

40:41.823 --> 40:44.724
Don't worry. It's mochi time!

40:44.744 --> 40:49.585
Okay, everyone see it. Let's pick again. One, two, three, we have...

40:49.685 --> 40:50.365
A zombie?

40:53.966 --> 40:56.848
This could be the last one. Everyone should be freaking right.

41:01.630 --> 41:01.890
After 15.

41:02.391 --> 41:02.751
Okay.

41:03.751 --> 41:11.515
Ah, they're dying to me.

41:11.896 --> 41:15.798
Is it because you can change the boundary of the map or something if you're only playing

41:15.818 --> 41:17.038
in a specific location, maybe?

41:18.500 --> 41:30.207
I think if I were playing, I'd definitely accidentally die.

41:30.927 --> 41:33.649
I feel like I would be out of the map.

41:40.232 --> 41:41.153
Five minutes to loot!

41:43.294 --> 41:47.995
Ami, Ami. My chat is going Ami, Ami, because there's a meme.

41:48.055 --> 41:49.916
There's like a meme of like Ami, Ami.

41:50.276 --> 41:50.736
Ami, Ami?

41:50.976 --> 41:52.836
He's like, can he or like...

41:53.817 --> 41:57.297
To be honest, I'm not too sure. I did ask chat yesterday, but...

41:57.317 --> 42:00.918
I haven't looked into it.

42:00.958 --> 42:03.659
There's a meme of Ami, Ami. That's why chat is going Ami, Ami.

42:03.679 --> 42:06.059
What is it? What is it? No! What do you mean no?

42:06.079 --> 42:10.540
I can't look down it.

42:10.261 --> 42:13.842
Don't tell her. I'm not telling her what the meme means, cause I don't know!

42:14.062 --> 42:16.442
Ew, why don't you guys want me to know?

42:16.862 --> 42:18.123
Suspicious, sus!

42:18.903 --> 42:19.503
Can I know?

42:20.083 --> 42:22.684
I mean, if Ami can know, can I know?

42:22.704 --> 42:25.324
Maybe it's yeah, bye.

42:25.725 --> 42:25.945
Bye.

42:26.025 --> 42:27.465
Oh, but she...

42:27.485 --> 42:27.625
Swore.

42:27.645 --> 42:28.965
You weren't recording it?

42:37.889 --> 42:39.771
All right, looks like everything's working well now

42:40.131 --> 42:40.391
Mm-hmm

42:40.872 --> 42:41.552
Oh, that's so far

42:41.572 --> 42:43.394
People are looting for the first five minutes

42:43.634 --> 42:44.375
Ooh, eh, cute

42:44.635 --> 42:44.955
A little...

42:46.637 --> 42:48.559
I'm looking at Louis Senpai's pili

42:49.219 --> 42:49.360
Ahh

42:49.800 --> 42:50.080
Hmm

42:52.623 --> 42:53.143
Going for the R99

42:53.183 --> 42:53.363
Wingman...

42:53.383 --> 42:53.523
Nope.

42:56.488 --> 42:58.369
No wingman. No wingman. No wingman. No wingman.

42:58.409 --> 42:59.550
That's me.

42:59.570 --> 42:59.970
Wingman.

42:59.990 --> 43:01.511
I'm gonna...

43:01.711 --> 43:03.312
If I say wingman, I'll ping it on you.

43:03.993 --> 43:04.113
Hey!

43:04.133 --> 43:05.594
Did anyone else?

43:05.614 --> 43:06.835
Did anyone else want...

43:07.475 --> 43:10.157
Someone who could use it? Preferably?

43:11.578 --> 43:13.619
Yes, I wonder how the rest of the game mode works.

43:13.659 --> 43:14.700
This is a zombie one.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.801
This is a longer one.

43:18.803 --> 43:20.704
I really want to see the free-for-all punching

43:26.554 --> 43:27.534
Eating ASMR

43:27.774 --> 43:30.075
Just Pocky, Pocky eating ASMR

43:31.715 --> 43:34.336
Zombies are only allowed to use their fists

43:34.456 --> 43:37.136
Weapons, loot, etc are prohibited

43:37.156 --> 43:37.756
So, okay

43:38.296 --> 43:38.977
I see

43:39.797 --> 43:40.457
Only with their fists

43:40.477 --> 43:42.897
It looks like Bey is a zombie

43:43.618 --> 43:44.818
She doesn't have any weapons

43:45.178 --> 43:47.799
Yeah, I guess she is a zombie

43:48.679 --> 43:51.119
Well, humans are like the complete opposite

43:51.139 --> 43:52.900
They're supposed to do as much as possible

43:53.020 --> 43:53.340
And run

43:53.360 --> 43:53.660
Oh my god

43:53.740 --> 43:59.644
Are they...I wonder if they're able to kill the people with guns with like one hit or something?

43:59.684 --> 44:00.005
Or they turn...

44:00.025 --> 44:01.586
With like the fist?

44:01.626 --> 44:02.787
How's how's that gonna...

44:03.667 --> 44:05.088
They turn them into zombies, maybe?

44:05.108 --> 44:08.671
How many zombies are there?

44:10.132 --> 44:10.812
Chat, do you guys know?

44:11.132 --> 44:11.353
There's...

44:11.633 --> 44:14.435
Competitive Pocky eating still on the Pocky?

44:14.975 --> 44:16.396
Competitive Pocky eating...

44:16.436 --> 44:18.738
We're not competing on Pocky!

44:18.818 --> 44:19.498
Please!

44:20.699 --> 44:21.620
That eating competition...

44:21.640 --> 44:22.800
They have to swarm them.

44:24.141 --> 44:24.862
Oh, I see, okay.

44:26.384 --> 44:27.205
Warm, okay.

44:28.666 --> 44:31.928
Play in groups, I see.

44:33.269 --> 44:34.709
Is she watching Choco Sensei?

44:36.891 --> 44:37.671
Purple Shield.

44:37.691 --> 44:41.614
How do you see which...

44:41.754 --> 44:42.234
Who it is?

44:43.395 --> 44:44.155
I can't read it.

44:44.836 --> 44:45.656
It's too small!

44:45.956 --> 44:46.637
I can't see!

44:46.737 --> 44:47.838
I can't see!

44:48.078 --> 44:49.579
It's a Bangalore, right?

44:49.879 --> 44:50.479
Yeah, yeah.

44:50.679 --> 44:52.140
I think that's good. Yeah, big fish.

44:52.921 --> 44:54.562
I can't see the text!

44:54.662 --> 44:55.582
Now we're switching over.

44:56.504 --> 44:57.104
It's a race

44:57.765 --> 44:58.485
A race?

44:58.825 --> 44:59.665
I...I think?

44:59.685 --> 45:01.706
I don't know who has the numbers

45:02.086 --> 45:02.606
Maybe it's Oma...

45:02.626 --> 45:04.607
Who has number?

45:05.527 --> 45:06.087
Is it Toa?

45:06.948 --> 45:07.268
No

45:07.648 --> 45:08.928
Toa is playing Revenant

45:10.629 --> 45:12.790
Robocop's a race?

45:15.311 --> 45:16.031
Lui-san

45:16.291 --> 45:16.751
Lui-san

45:16.911 --> 45:17.291
Amu-san

45:17.491 --> 45:18.072
Lui-senpai

45:18.812 --> 45:19.512
Lu...Lui-san

45:19.992 --> 45:20.652
Also, Renae-san

45:21.013 --> 45:21.533
Renae-chi

45:21.673 --> 45:23.193
Let's hope it'll load.

45:24.314 --> 45:26.995
The P.O.B. were opening. They were mostly rigged.

45:27.576 --> 45:29.796
Yeah, Annyeong's playing.

45:30.577 --> 45:31.977
Oh! Oh, Budha!

45:32.037 --> 45:33.198
Scania!

45:33.318 --> 45:33.678
Ah, she's...

45:33.698 --> 45:34.658
Scania!

45:34.798 --> 45:35.598
She's a zombie too.

45:36.039 --> 45:37.039
Oh! Oh my god!

45:37.419 --> 45:39.300
They're doing some, uh, ritual here.

45:39.320 --> 45:40.220
She's a zombie.

45:40.400 --> 45:41.620
Ritual? Zombie ritual!

45:41.660 --> 45:42.881
The teabag ritual.

45:43.181 --> 45:43.821
Oh god.

45:43.841 --> 45:46.022
I thought she was all out

45:47.103 --> 45:48.424
Toxic, unite!

45:49.505 --> 45:52.227
I think they're still waiting probably for the 5 minutes to be up, and then...

45:52.247 --> 45:53.988
Uh-huh. Is it free-for-all then?

45:54.409 --> 45:56.190
Like, do they just go at it, swarm them?

45:56.690 --> 45:58.732
I think so. I think they... Wait, I think...

45:58.752 --> 46:06.637
Yeah, within limited time. They don't see how long.

46:07.338 --> 46:08.258
Okay, okay.

46:08.839 --> 46:10.480
I think they're still waiting to attack.

46:10.540 --> 46:11.100
Yeah, they are.

46:15.665 --> 46:17.966
Oh, they're all going into...

46:17.986 --> 46:23.487
They're all...under revenants effects

46:24.848 --> 46:26.288
Yeah, redo's name that is

46:26.828 --> 46:26.948
Ina?

46:26.968 --> 46:27.409
You're free!

46:45.836 --> 46:47.157
I think that's Yopi

46:47.637 --> 46:48.137
Yopi

46:48.157 --> 46:52.020
I feel like I have to sneeze

46:53.041 --> 46:53.681
You can sneeze

46:54.762 --> 46:55.083
Oh wait

46:55.923 --> 46:56.424
Now I can't

46:56.444 --> 46:56.824
Oh god

46:57.004 --> 46:57.264
Oh no

46:57.304 --> 46:59.146
You scared it away

46:59.166 --> 46:59.746
I scared it away

46:59.886 --> 47:00.086
No

47:00.126 --> 47:00.246
No

47:00.327 --> 47:06.831
I don't think I'm gonna be able to finish it

47:07.252 --> 47:07.932
Of course

47:08.293 --> 47:08.773
Of course

47:08.793 --> 47:10.654
I don't think I'm gonna be able to finish it

47:16.368 --> 47:22.831
Actually never hiccup never yeah, is there something wrong with me? Maybe maybe you're leaking somewhere

47:22.871 --> 47:33.737
You know you don't need to hiccup

47:34.258 --> 47:34.438
No

47:34.518 --> 47:35.398
It's like unable

47:36.639 --> 47:43.263
We had Umaibo, they're like these big cheeto sticks and they have different flavors.

47:44.544 --> 47:46.665
Oh, it doesn't taste like the butter corn.

47:46.685 --> 47:48.125
I guess it's just the butter flavoring.

47:48.425 --> 47:49.885
Which one is your favorite flavor?

47:50.005 --> 47:50.605
The mai bo?

47:50.945 --> 47:52.125
Oh. Oh, that's the flavor?

47:52.145 --> 47:53.626
No, no, no. This is the stick.

47:53.766 --> 47:55.326
I like the butter.

47:55.406 --> 47:56.246
Buttered corn.

47:56.886 --> 47:57.786
Butter and corn.

47:58.347 --> 48:00.327
Yeah, you know, actually they have corn ice cream.

48:00.767 --> 48:03.187
And it's like corn flavored and shaped like a big corn.

48:05.548 --> 48:06.188
Would you eat that?

48:06.788 --> 48:07.648
I would try.

48:07.668 --> 48:09.568
I don't mind trying.

48:09.588 --> 48:11.349
Uh, do you eat vegetables?

48:13.209 --> 48:17.290
No. Her face says no.

48:17.890 --> 48:22.431
She took one look and was like, nope.

48:24.791 --> 48:26.331
I mean, here I tried it.

48:26.632 --> 48:30.592
I mean, I just like dabble here and there, maybe.

48:31.032 --> 48:32.032
I give it, I'll eat it.

48:33.793 --> 48:36.693
I like the vegetables here. They have like stewed veggies that are really tasty.

48:42.633 --> 48:44.893
And the zombies are using Revenant's ult?

48:44.953 --> 48:48.694
I guess to give them some immunity

48:48.714 --> 48:50.814
So they don't die die

48:50.834 --> 48:55.435
Is Ana using her um...

48:56.035 --> 48:59.816
I think it's the image

48:59.876 --> 49:02.476
That's like the overlay?

49:02.936 --> 49:03.696
What? Her...

49:04.216 --> 49:04.877
Oh no no no

49:05.097 --> 49:05.677
God, I was like...

49:05.897 --> 49:07.037
I was so confused, like...

49:07.857 --> 49:09.357
Together it's very low.

49:09.857 --> 49:10.417
What, her image?

49:11.958 --> 49:12.479
Her new outfit?

49:13.799 --> 49:15.500
Oh, no no, there was like this like...

49:15.700 --> 49:17.141
I thought she was like using her...oh...

49:17.661 --> 49:18.321
I might be wrong

49:18.341 --> 49:20.022
I haven't played Blahon in like...

49:20.382 --> 49:20.703
Ages

49:25.085 --> 49:28.867
No veggies

49:28.907 --> 49:32.128
You gotta try these bean sprouts that they give you like at the yakiniku places

49:32.188 --> 49:33.209
No!

49:33.309 --> 49:34.630
Why?

49:35.770 --> 49:39.592
I don't like, I don't like beanspouts!

49:38.552 --> 49:40.633
I don't like beans, Brown!

49:40.673 --> 49:41.013
Why not?

49:41.133 --> 49:43.674
They're beans and they're green!

49:43.754 --> 49:44.914
They're not green, they're like...

49:46.075 --> 49:46.675
yellowish

49:46.775 --> 49:48.695
But they're beans!

49:50.656 --> 49:52.937
They're so tasty!

49:53.077 --> 49:54.477
Are you gonna make me eat it later?

49:54.977 --> 49:57.678
You'll try one, right? You'll try one?

49:57.698 --> 49:57.758
One...

49:58.498 --> 49:58.698
One...

49:59.379 --> 50:00.799
One bean, one beans, Brown

50:00.819 --> 50:02.260
One this...this much

50:02.860 --> 50:04.880
It's got sesame oil on it, it's really tasty.

50:06.942 --> 50:08.782
Gura and I will fight over, like, the green dust

50:08.882 --> 50:11.443
What are they called?

50:12.403 --> 50:13.764
Sprouted beans

50:14.584 --> 50:15.384
Bean sprouts, yeah

50:15.684 --> 50:16.365
Bean sprouts

50:18.025 --> 50:20.186
I'll give it all to you, guys

50:21.086 --> 50:22.227
Take all my beans

50:23.207 --> 50:24.187
Take all my beans

50:24.848 --> 50:25.088
Fine

50:25.588 --> 50:25.928
I will

50:26.568 --> 50:29.549
Chat says, Forcer

50:29.629 --> 50:30.189
Oh, Forcer

50:30.469 --> 50:30.569
No

50:30.609 --> 50:33.110
Someone over there!

50:34.971 --> 50:38.652
Inserting Tom in there.

50:38.573 --> 50:40.474
Over beans? Come on.

50:41.355 --> 50:42.595
Gonna get scurvy one day.

50:44.797 --> 50:45.697
We don't know when.

50:45.717 --> 50:50.520
I'll live.

50:50.980 --> 50:51.380
For now.

50:51.740 --> 50:52.241
For now.

50:53.802 --> 50:54.542
For now is enough.

50:56.483 --> 50:58.084
It says also they hate beans, bros.

50:58.104 --> 50:59.445
I don't know how you guys can hate beans, bros.

50:59.465 --> 51:00.765
They're so tasty.

51:01.106 --> 51:02.326
I'm not alone.

51:02.366 --> 51:03.307
They're tasty.

51:03.407 --> 51:04.848
I'm not alone.

51:04.868 --> 51:05.168
from one...

51:05.328 --> 51:07.289
I'm not alone.

51:07.951 --> 51:11.113
Not alone

51:11.153 --> 51:16.036
What are you guys gonna eat for dinner? No clue

51:16.176 --> 51:17.036
Yeah, we don't know yet

51:17.517 --> 51:18.157
Don't know yet

51:18.317 --> 51:19.278
We'll tell you guys after though

51:19.518 --> 51:20.599
Food, obviously

51:20.899 --> 51:21.659
Yeah, food

51:21.959 --> 51:22.340
Duh

51:22.620 --> 51:23.500
Duh

51:24.081 --> 51:24.381
baby

51:35.517 --> 51:38.638
Oh, they're gonna fight each other, let's see.

51:38.979 --> 51:40.019
Oh...

51:40.079 --> 51:41.920
I think she said they might form an alliance?

51:42.220 --> 51:43.881
Hiding right now from the zombies?

51:44.861 --> 51:46.042
An alliance?

51:46.602 --> 51:47.242
Alliance.

51:49.103 --> 51:51.284
Is this, like, to each their own, or is it, like...

51:51.664 --> 51:52.404
I think so.

51:52.424 --> 51:54.425
Cause everybody lands, like, in a...

51:54.925 --> 51:55.626
Different place.

51:56.526 --> 51:58.327
I thought I saw some people in a team, but...

52:00.047 --> 52:00.528
Cause Anya...

52:00.548 --> 52:03.089
Oh, yeah, Anya's on the team because she's part of the zombie squad

52:04.370 --> 52:06.971
They can use their weapons, right?

52:07.031 --> 52:09.371
Bae and Ella are out

52:10.111 --> 52:11.312
Oh no

52:12.032 --> 52:13.052
They can use their weapons

52:13.412 --> 52:14.652
Uh, not zombies though, zombies

52:14.952 --> 52:17.333
Hmm, zombies are not allowed to do anything

52:17.413 --> 52:18.073
But their fists

52:21.254 --> 52:22.314
We missed the action

52:22.334 --> 52:23.374
One more?

52:23.474 --> 52:24.395
Let me check

52:36.479 --> 52:38.160
Oh, I guess they formed an alliance.

52:38.180 --> 52:40.182
They formed an alliance, I see.

52:40.602 --> 52:43.984
Gura's trying to protect her territory with her gun right now.

52:46.746 --> 52:47.647
We're watching.

52:47.667 --> 52:53.291
They died, they died.

52:53.431 --> 52:53.651
Dead.

52:55.092 --> 52:55.633
Missed it.

52:56.093 --> 52:56.313
Dead.

52:56.954 --> 52:58.575
I see if they expected a...

52:58.595 --> 52:59.255
Louie killed them.

53:00.056 --> 53:01.136
Ah, Louie killed them.

53:02.497 --> 53:04.379
Oh, oh, oh! Look at Louie's pill needle!

53:08.984 --> 53:11.166
And so if the zombies die, they don't respawn I guess.

53:12.167 --> 53:12.908
I guess so.

53:13.088 --> 53:14.149
Oh oh oh oh!

53:14.289 --> 53:14.629
What?

53:14.649 --> 53:15.150
Taken out.

53:15.190 --> 53:15.430
Damn.

53:15.770 --> 53:17.432
It must be hard as a zombie to like...

53:17.492 --> 53:18.252
How do you...

53:18.613 --> 53:20.254
How do you survive that?

53:20.354 --> 53:20.955
Oh my god.

53:21.015 --> 53:21.395
I'm gonna die.

53:21.495 --> 53:21.876
I'm gonna die.

53:21.936 --> 53:22.456
I'm gonna die.

53:22.816 --> 53:26.520
I'm gonna die.

53:26.540 --> 53:26.900
I'm gonna die.

53:26.920 --> 53:27.501
I'm gonna die.

53:27.521 --> 53:28.341
I'm gonna die.

53:28.361 --> 53:29.382
I'm gonna die.

53:29.662 --> 53:30.123
I'm gonna die.

53:30.143 --> 53:30.483
I'm gonna die.

53:30.503 --> 53:30.823
I'm gonna die.

53:29.864 --> 53:31.265
Oh, she's...she's low, though.

53:31.285 --> 53:32.826
I wonder if you can heal.

53:32.846 --> 53:32.906
I...oh...

53:33.406 --> 53:34.266
Oh no!

53:34.326 --> 53:36.147
The whole spot, take it out!

53:36.427 --> 53:38.008
Oh no! Who is that?

53:38.028 --> 53:39.409
I can't read it.

53:39.429 --> 53:42.811
Uh, isn't this...isn't this just Louis's friend?

53:43.231 --> 53:44.391
No, no, it's different.

53:44.612 --> 53:46.793
I can't see it.

53:47.473 --> 53:49.474
Louis...Louis! It is Louis's friend.

53:49.494 --> 53:50.855
Ah, it must be the delay.

53:50.875 --> 53:51.815
Oh, yeah, yeah.

53:52.156 --> 53:54.077
I see. It is Louis's friend.

53:54.697 --> 53:55.337
Louis's sweep.

53:56.078 --> 53:57.918
She's gaming, Louie Sweep!

53:59.723 --> 54:02.663
Cobo killed...

54:03.964 --> 54:05.304
No, killed Gali

54:05.804 --> 54:08.464
Oh no, that...

54:08.784 --> 54:09.484
Is it that?

54:12.345 --> 54:16.686
Ah, okay, so zombies can revive, I see

54:16.706 --> 54:23.647
That's fair though, cause like, if they were like...

54:24.327 --> 54:27.727
They only have their fists and they're coming up against people with guns

54:29.289 --> 54:32.952
I don't know, I guess there's not a limit to how many times you can revive in a game, huh?

54:33.773 --> 54:35.334
Like, one person?

54:35.454 --> 54:37.516
I guess it's fine as long as you're in the zone.

54:37.576 --> 54:37.676
Iris?

54:38.016 --> 54:38.296
Let's see.

54:38.316 --> 54:38.997
Ah, Ania's low.

54:39.017 --> 54:40.338
You can heal I guess zombies heal

54:59.130 --> 54:59.570
What?

54:59.590 --> 55:00.391
Iris, no.

55:00.451 --> 55:00.571
Rip.

55:00.591 --> 55:00.731
Rip.

55:00.751 --> 55:01.132
So, who died?

55:01.312 --> 55:03.393
I think Iris died.

55:03.413 --> 55:05.855
Calli died.

55:07.156 --> 55:08.357
Anya's out.

55:08.377 --> 55:08.777
Adiós!

55:24.790 --> 55:29.312
No, she's a zombie she's fine. Oh, yeah, she'll get revived. Yeah, she'll be she'll be up in no time

55:29.332 --> 55:34.753
Because then a zombie if there's like one zombie left they have to go on a mission to like revive everybody. You're right

55:35.574 --> 55:37.594
But maybe they can they can only do it on their teams

55:38.915 --> 55:40.655
But once the team is wiped out, that's it

55:42.816 --> 55:43.976
Virus

55:45.156 --> 55:45.857
They're vibrant

55:47.307 --> 55:54.229
If you were if we were to join what side do you want to be on the zombie or like the human?

55:54.289 --> 55:55.669
I'm gonna be human

55:55.689 --> 55:58.310
Me too. I feel like I want to shoot at people

55:59.311 --> 56:00.531
It's much more fun, Nellie.

56:00.551 --> 56:04.592
It's easier because, you know, they don't have guns, so I feel like it'd be pretty easy.

56:07.196 --> 56:09.797
But maybe there's a lot of them, they gotta, like, plan it out

56:10.078 --> 56:12.079
It's like, aiming practice

56:12.279 --> 56:14.401
I wonder if they have, like, a zombie chat

56:14.421 --> 56:16.862
Where they're, like, gathering in one spot

56:16.902 --> 56:18.904
They're like, alright guys, we gotta gather here

56:18.924 --> 56:22.927
I'm not sure, I think Anya did that with, like, the ritual thingy

56:22.987 --> 56:23.467
Right

56:23.547 --> 56:29.071
But we couldn't possibly know what those zombies were talking about

56:29.091 --> 56:29.171
Yeah

56:29.731 --> 56:30.732
I mean, we could listen

56:31.132 --> 56:32.193
Oh, it looks like here...

56:32.213 --> 56:35.695
Ah, okay, these are the people who are alive.

56:38.902 --> 56:40.022
Oh, this would be nice

56:40.342 --> 56:41.042
Oh, let's see

56:44.843 --> 56:45.863
Frozen

56:46.404 --> 56:47.464
That P.O.B. is frozen

56:47.684 --> 56:48.224
It's okay

56:49.384 --> 56:51.165
That way they will never die

56:51.185 --> 56:54.286
She'll stay alive

56:54.366 --> 56:56.446
Yeah, she'll stay alive until the end of the quest

56:56.666 --> 56:57.007
Yes

56:57.767 --> 57:00.327
There's so many people

57:00.347 --> 57:00.427
Yeah

57:00.968 --> 57:04.229
Yohikura

57:04.449 --> 57:05.689
Iris! Ina!

57:06.647 --> 57:09.108
I think it's Louis

57:10.068 --> 57:10.408
Oh, I think...

57:10.448 --> 57:11.109
She's taken out

57:11.449 --> 57:11.629
What?

57:12.349 --> 57:12.809
By who?

57:12.829 --> 57:13.710
Looks like she's yelling

57:13.730 --> 57:14.910
By who?

57:15.191 --> 57:16.131
I can tell

57:16.431 --> 57:21.994
We can't tell

57:22.094 --> 57:22.374
By?

57:22.674 --> 57:22.894
By who?

57:22.914 --> 57:24.395
Do they realize?

57:24.735 --> 57:24.955
Wait

57:25.635 --> 57:26.356
Must have been...

57:26.416 --> 57:29.637
Louis is down, what happened?

57:29.657 --> 57:30.358
We don't know

57:30.398 --> 57:31.478
We don't know, Ali

57:31.518 --> 57:33.379
That's what we were trying to find out!

57:37.538 --> 57:39.500
And I feel like I'm watching a drama show

57:40.640 --> 57:41.401
With my fork

57:41.461 --> 57:43.082
It looks like the...

57:43.242 --> 57:52.069
Maybe she was the kill leader

57:52.289 --> 57:52.809
Kobol?

57:52.850 --> 57:55.191
Yeah, she can really make anything happen

58:05.948 --> 58:07.549
A miracle

58:07.629 --> 58:08.310
A miracle

58:08.710 --> 58:10.311
A brain shaman

58:11.111 --> 58:12.152
Possible, it's possible

58:12.172 --> 58:16.895
She can make, like, it rain in the map and then we have to evacuate or something

58:17.456 --> 58:18.136
Cobo way

58:18.436 --> 58:20.237
Cobo way or no way?

58:20.758 --> 58:23.680
I wonder if Cobo is a...

58:24.841 --> 58:26.682
A survivor or a zombie?

58:27.242 --> 58:29.784
That would be nice to know.

58:35.369 --> 58:40.111
Hmm, zombie zombie. Maybe Kubo's gonna go after Gura.

58:40.431 --> 58:51.937
What Ali? Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.

58:52.258 --> 58:54.919
I don't think he has a peep on his one peep.

58:54.939 --> 58:57.761
She has his four.

58:58.321 --> 58:59.261
Yeah, so he has the zone is-

58:59.381 --> 59:01.383
Oh, the zone is really small if you look at the map

59:03.024 --> 59:03.965
Yeah, it is very scary.

59:04.325 --> 59:05.626
I wonder if anybody will fall off here.

59:05.646 --> 59:06.787
You know, like in the center?

59:06.807 --> 59:06.947
Oh, gosh.

59:07.087 --> 59:11.090
The zombies accidentally jump off.

59:12.550 --> 59:14.972
Well, they still have their teammates, so...

59:15.452 --> 59:17.053
Yeah, but I don't think you can even rez here.

59:17.073 --> 59:22.176
Oh, no.

59:23.337 --> 59:25.699
Watching Lui's POV is very fun as well.

59:26.019 --> 59:27.019
I think she's dead. She's...

59:27.199 --> 59:29.541
She's spectating, um...

59:30.241 --> 59:31.202
I? Is that you now?

59:31.302 --> 59:31.502
I think

59:33.164 --> 59:36.967
Yeah, that might be, you know

59:37.027 --> 59:38.808
I think Louis-senpai was kill leader

59:39.188 --> 59:40.108
Or I think...

59:40.569 --> 59:43.170
The mommy's did them

59:43.190 --> 59:44.151
Took out the whole squad

59:44.171 --> 59:50.134
Somebody's gonna fall in the center

59:50.334 --> 59:52.795
No, somebody's gonna fall!

59:53.496 --> 59:55.057
We'll see

59:55.077 --> 59:58.338
Ah, cause I guess the circle's gonna close right on the...

59:58.759 --> 59:59.559
The hole, maybe?

01:00:00.461 --> 01:00:01.921
Yeah, the...that one, right?

01:00:02.021 --> 01:00:02.801
The one in the middle?

01:00:10.024 --> 01:00:13.385
It is kind of like hide-and-seek.

01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:17.407
Wait, who's that, right?

01:00:17.907 --> 01:00:18.787
Who's this zombie?

01:00:19.827 --> 01:00:23.529
I got it! She accidentally crouched!

01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:24.169
I think she must've...

01:00:24.189 --> 01:00:27.370
Oh wow! That's so close! That's so close!

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:27.451
Wiped out!

01:00:27.571 --> 01:00:31.152
But, I don't think she would've survived in here, cause there's almost coming in, but...

01:00:31.192 --> 01:00:32.353
That's true, yeah.

01:00:35.094 --> 01:00:36.755
Are there even that many zombies left?

01:00:37.495 --> 01:00:37.995
Yeah.

01:00:39.856 --> 01:00:40.937
Maybe there's a zombie P.O.V.

01:00:40.957 --> 01:00:41.617
How many zombies?

01:00:41.677 --> 01:00:41.957
Roboco!

01:00:41.977 --> 01:00:43.458
No, I think she has a gun.

01:00:43.478 --> 01:00:44.018
Toa's down.

01:00:44.038 --> 01:00:44.538
Toa's down.

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:44.618
Bye!

01:00:58.967 --> 01:01:00.928
It's still loading!

01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:02.369
Game over!

01:01:02.389 --> 01:01:02.529
What?

01:01:02.649 --> 01:01:04.610
Who won?

01:01:07.932 --> 01:01:09.732
I think...I think the survivors won.

01:01:10.753 --> 01:01:11.793
Gura carried...

01:01:11.813 --> 01:01:13.334
Hunters!

01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:17.896
What was the last zombie?

01:01:18.076 --> 01:01:22.779
Wait, what?

01:01:22.959 --> 01:01:23.639
I'm Hunter.

01:01:23.659 --> 01:01:25.520
Oma, I can imagine her POV.

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:27.201
She's probably screaming her ass off.

01:01:28.422 --> 01:01:31.924
What? What? What? How?

01:01:32.004 --> 01:01:32.445
proteins.

01:01:32.725 --> 01:01:35.246
generalized fun

01:01:35.346 --> 01:01:36.147
N.B.P

01:01:36.367 --> 01:01:37.167
MVP!

01:01:45.203 --> 01:01:45.883
That was fun

01:01:45.903 --> 01:01:46.023
Yeah

01:01:46.223 --> 01:01:47.784
That was fun, that was fun

01:01:47.864 --> 01:01:50.125
I'm excited for the next game to...

01:01:50.425 --> 01:01:50.885
Punching

01:01:51.686 --> 01:01:53.527
Oh, we're gonna go straight to boxing?

01:01:53.687 --> 01:01:54.387
I think so

01:01:54.747 --> 01:01:56.328
Boxing match

01:01:57.208 --> 01:01:58.809
Boxing match

01:01:58.989 --> 01:01:59.790
Bwah bwah bwah

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:01.310
Bwah bwah

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:03.271
Bwah bwah bwah

01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:05.553
Oh my gosh, you're so good at boxing

01:02:05.853 --> 01:02:06.613
friendly fire.

01:02:07.554 --> 01:02:09.535
I can't wait. My favorite match.

01:02:10.476 --> 01:02:12.497
I'm not even in a match. Let's go!

01:02:12.557 --> 01:02:14.478
I feel like if I were playing, I'd totally lose.

01:02:14.518 --> 01:02:15.418
And like boxing.

01:02:15.778 --> 01:02:16.519
And apex.

01:02:17.019 --> 01:02:17.839
That seems difficult.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.840
It is difficult. It is difficult.

01:02:20.701 --> 01:02:21.441
Zukasi.

01:02:21.981 --> 01:02:24.643
No, Zukasi. Zukasi is a hero.

01:02:26.504 --> 01:02:27.364
Kobo malding.

01:02:27.384 --> 01:02:28.705
Kobo is malding.

01:02:30.526 --> 01:02:31.066
She not.

01:02:32.226 --> 01:02:35.388
I feel her though. I would be screaming it as well.

01:02:35.508 --> 01:02:36.629
as like the last zombie.

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:49.956
Well, I think you guys already know

01:02:49.976 --> 01:02:51.997
Well, I think you guys already know

01:02:52.057 --> 01:02:52.817
Best zombie!

01:02:52.837 --> 01:02:53.157
Don't you?

01:02:53.177 --> 01:02:53.858
Gobo Kamehru!

01:02:53.918 --> 01:02:54.258
Yay!

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:56.779
Best zombie!

01:02:56.799 --> 01:02:57.339
Best zombie!

01:02:57.379 --> 01:02:57.619
Best zombie!

01:02:57.639 --> 01:02:58.500
Last arrive

01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.220
Best zombie!

01:02:59.580 --> 01:02:59.800
Nice!

01:02:59.961 --> 01:03:01.581
All the discord icons, I know

01:03:02.222 --> 01:03:03.402
There's so many!

01:03:03.482 --> 01:03:05.883
There's so many!

01:03:05.983 --> 01:03:06.544
So cute.

01:03:09.256 --> 01:03:10.017
Oh, my God.

01:03:10.878 --> 01:03:12.058
I got killed.

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:14.881
My translator.

01:03:14.921 --> 01:03:15.761
Oh, my translator!

01:03:16.101 --> 01:03:17.703
hahaha, a personal traveler

01:03:38.499 --> 01:03:39.960
Do you still want the burger?

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:41.220
I feel like I'm full

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.020
Whole burger is for me

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:43.441
Yeah...

01:03:43.621 --> 01:03:45.081
I don't really like these that much

01:03:47.001 --> 01:03:48.182
Inna!

01:03:48.842 --> 01:03:50.182
Inna!

01:03:50.382 --> 01:03:51.522
She's busy, she's busy

01:03:51.562 --> 01:03:52.803
Inna!

01:03:52.843 --> 01:03:55.183
Please eat the burgers!

01:03:55.223 --> 01:03:56.684
She's not gonna want these either

01:03:56.704 --> 01:03:57.044
Okay, well...

01:03:57.064 --> 01:04:00.004
The bird will eat after all.

01:04:08.247 --> 01:04:09.507
Oh, you're an accident, okay.

01:04:09.608 --> 01:04:11.588
Oh, there he goes!

01:04:11.628 --> 01:04:12.989
That one, babe.

01:04:14.429 --> 01:04:14.869
Okay.

01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:16.350
Alright!

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:18.131
Let's go!

01:04:18.151 --> 01:04:19.651
Let's go!

01:04:20.291 --> 01:04:20.412
No.

01:04:24.074 --> 01:04:29.856
and yeah what the it sounded like they were talking to us yeah it's tough hello hello

01:04:31.177 --> 01:04:34.839
maybe we're in the discord call all along we could we probably could but

01:04:35.259 --> 01:04:42.282
we shouldn't by listening to the stream audio

01:04:44.003 --> 01:04:46.544
Punching time! I think there's two rounds of this, isn't there?

01:04:47.746 --> 01:04:51.427
Yeah, wait, let me check. I am the game master after all. I got this.

01:04:51.987 --> 01:04:55.888
In one moment, let me open my cheat code.

01:04:56.268 --> 01:04:59.229
I wonder if there's two rounds, there's two winners.

01:05:00.491 --> 01:05:01.691
Boxing match

01:05:02.051 --> 01:05:02.551
No rules

01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:03.591
Just two rounds

01:05:04.091 --> 01:05:04.672
Okay

01:05:05.072 --> 01:05:05.852
Two winners

01:05:05.932 --> 01:05:07.172
Two rounds, two winners

01:05:07.232 --> 01:05:08.133
We'll see, we'll see

01:05:08.193 --> 01:05:09.153
Now this is fun

01:05:09.333 --> 01:05:09.813
Yeah

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:11.133
Everyone is equal

01:05:11.393 --> 01:05:11.974
Kind of

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.994
So everyone will land in that one area, I guess?

01:05:14.014 --> 01:05:14.314
Yeah

01:05:14.454 --> 01:05:16.435
In the map, the boxing ring

01:05:16.615 --> 01:05:17.495
Wait, isn't that in...

01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:19.616
Is it in this map or...

01:05:19.876 --> 01:05:20.756
Isn't it in a different map?

01:05:21.236 --> 01:05:22.416
I guess it's gonna be somewhere else

01:05:22.436 --> 01:05:24.617
We'll see

01:05:24.757 --> 01:05:26.097
and not the boxing ring.

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:32.021
I don't know, whenever I think about the boxing match, I would expect it in a boxing ring, but...

01:05:32.882 --> 01:05:37.525
I mean, it could be anywhere else, I guess we'll see

01:05:39.986 --> 01:05:40.987
What's with the double audio?

01:05:42.708 --> 01:05:43.388
Ever in the...

01:05:43.749 --> 01:05:44.609
I don't know

01:05:46.771 --> 01:05:47.311
What is this?

01:05:47.331 --> 01:05:50.333
But I thought...

01:05:52.094 --> 01:05:55.136
Me and my thoughts at night

01:05:56.256 --> 01:05:57.017
What is happening?

01:05:59.059 --> 01:06:12.024
I think she fixed it no wait chaos double audience double audience wait that's like quadruple audio then

01:06:12.905 --> 01:06:17.687
oh but it's not coming from us right it's not from us it's not from us it's not from us

01:06:27.075 --> 01:06:29.495
They're fighting. They're revving up.

01:06:31.116 --> 01:06:32.456
Satsuga M-chan.

01:06:32.636 --> 01:06:36.157
One more.

01:06:36.877 --> 01:06:38.778
One more, one more.

01:06:38.798 --> 01:06:39.998
They fixed it. There was an echo.

01:06:40.018 --> 01:06:40.499
I know our translator

01:06:55.844 --> 01:06:57.725
Oh. Thank you, thank you.

01:06:58.545 --> 01:07:04.829
Thank you, Ano.

01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:08.271
Haiyai...Haiyai-ne!

01:07:08.411 --> 01:07:11.633
Alright, no weapons.

01:07:11.733 --> 01:07:12.694
Ah, it looks like you can!

01:07:13.054 --> 01:07:13.854
And can you pick the map?

01:07:13.894 --> 01:07:14.655
Oh yeah, you can!

01:07:14.735 --> 01:07:16.016
Oh, that's so cool!

01:07:16.036 --> 01:07:17.656
You can pick the map, chat.

01:07:17.957 --> 01:07:18.237
Oh, oh.

01:07:18.277 --> 01:07:18.837
Wait, what is that?

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:24.984
Interesting, interesting. We're getting a glimpse into the custom...

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:26.405
The new custom mode.

01:07:26.425 --> 01:07:26.565
Uh-oh.

01:07:26.745 --> 01:07:30.268
What is that?

01:07:30.308 --> 01:07:31.990
Come on!

01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:32.570
Um...

01:07:33.992 --> 01:07:35.273
Hold on, just give me a second.

01:07:40.503 --> 01:07:43.967
We're good, we're definitely good

01:07:44.028 --> 01:07:49.474
They saw my files earlier, I have like 3 gigs on my computer

01:07:49.654 --> 01:07:52.437
No way, do you have to cut it out?

01:07:52.978 --> 01:07:53.598
Cut it out?

01:07:54.299 --> 01:07:57.363
Oh, no. It's okay. I lost two watts in two weeks.

01:07:58.046 --> 01:07:59.887
Huh?

01:08:00.067 --> 01:08:02.749
Yeah, I lost my kimono, um...

01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:04.230
Kimono...

01:08:04.691 --> 01:08:05.872
Post-kimono...

01:08:06.492 --> 01:08:07.653
That's a dumb talk.

01:08:07.853 --> 01:08:08.213
Oh no!

01:08:08.233 --> 01:08:08.554
Cause like...

01:08:08.574 --> 01:08:10.275
I showed like the UI.

01:08:11.356 --> 01:08:11.516
Ahh!

01:08:11.656 --> 01:08:12.437
No, I don't have to cut it out.

01:08:12.457 --> 01:08:13.417
It's just, it's just chrome.

01:08:13.818 --> 01:08:15.779
It's just chrome saying you don't have enough space.

01:08:15.799 --> 01:08:16.860
I know.

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:20.002
What's happening?

01:08:30.946 --> 01:08:31.867
They're all raised

01:08:33.447 --> 01:08:34.647
I'm raised, I'm raised

01:08:34.847 --> 01:08:37.168
Oh no, they're all...

01:08:37.268 --> 01:08:39.868
You can see how sweaty they are based on their skin

01:08:40.148 --> 01:08:40.708
We'll see

01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:42.069
We'll see

01:08:42.449 --> 01:08:43.589
Let's see, uh...

01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:46.650
Default skin, default skin

01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:47.290
Let's see

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:48.250
Oh, Anya have a...

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:50.110
Not too sure

01:08:51.671 --> 01:08:54.071
Anya doesn't play Apex that much

01:08:54.091 --> 01:08:56.092
Let's see

01:08:56.552 --> 01:08:57.712
Mel probably has a...

01:08:58.512 --> 01:08:59.052
big skin

01:08:59.733 --> 01:09:00.353
Nice skin

01:09:00.413 --> 01:09:01.654
Do you have a...

01:09:01.794 --> 01:09:02.615
Raid skin?

01:09:03.595 --> 01:09:04.236
I don't have one

01:09:04.516 --> 01:09:05.616
Oh, I don't have one either

01:09:07.277 --> 01:09:07.897
I wish I did

01:09:07.917 --> 01:09:09.158
Oh no, I don't really play it that much

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:10.499
You don't really play it that much

01:09:10.839 --> 01:09:12.260
No, I play it for like...

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.281
When I'm like super bored

01:09:14.501 --> 01:09:16.802
And I wanna change up like pace or something

01:09:16.842 --> 01:09:19.204
Okay, I play Raid

01:09:19.224 --> 01:09:20.824
Oh, Raid, Raid

01:09:21.085 --> 01:09:23.686
Raid, yeah

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:25.107
I love Oli's sword, so cute

01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:26.367
It is so cute

01:09:26.427 --> 01:09:27.108
I like how it's like

01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:29.710
Moving behind her back, yeah

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:31.411
Is it connected? Is it just random?

01:09:32.172 --> 01:09:33.492
Oh, I think it's just random

01:09:33.733 --> 01:09:34.673
Oh, cute!

01:09:38.115 --> 01:09:39.496
You don't know when she'll be...

01:09:40.216 --> 01:09:42.317
You know, unleashing her sword

01:09:42.818 --> 01:09:43.718
Oh, we should make bets

01:09:43.758 --> 01:09:45.539
Who do you think will come out on top here?

01:09:46.119 --> 01:09:47.280
Oh, yeah, we should

01:09:49.681 --> 01:09:50.842
I'm gonna say...

01:09:51.482 --> 01:09:51.943
Louis?

01:09:52.683 --> 01:09:54.424
Maybe? It's a good pick

01:09:54.644 --> 01:09:55.325
That's a good pick

01:09:55.745 --> 01:09:57.066
She's a very strong contender

01:09:57.166 --> 01:09:57.466
I know.

01:09:58.908 --> 01:10:00.788
Let's see if they're just running around and playing...

01:10:00.808 --> 01:10:04.049
Who's that? Somebody has a red wraith skin.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:05.730
I'm gonna say...

01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:07.330
Oh, there's two.

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:08.231
Wait, there's two?

01:10:08.251 --> 01:10:09.791
Two red wraiths, yeah.

01:10:09.991 --> 01:10:11.732
Who do you think will win?

01:10:12.192 --> 01:10:14.673
I'm not too sure, but I think...

01:10:15.933 --> 01:10:16.633
I feel like...

01:10:17.434 --> 01:10:19.574
I feel like the people who...

01:10:20.495 --> 01:10:23.215
Doesn't play Apex that much might win this round.

01:10:23.255 --> 01:10:23.796
Really? Yeah?

01:10:24.196 --> 01:10:24.496
Yeah.

01:10:24.536 --> 01:10:25.776
I see chat, chat says Toa

01:10:27.157 --> 01:10:31.659
Maybe she knows some movement tricks to, like, avoid getting punched too much

01:10:33.059 --> 01:10:34.780
I mean, Toa Senpai always knows too much

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:36.561
She's an apex

01:10:36.921 --> 01:10:39.102
She's a different person

01:10:39.242 --> 01:10:40.942
She's too good at apex

01:10:40.962 --> 01:10:43.023
She's too good at apex sometimes

01:10:43.043 --> 01:10:44.244
She's too good

01:10:44.544 --> 01:10:45.644
Bring the wind home

01:10:47.485 --> 01:10:51.686
Kobo? Maybe Kobo?

01:10:51.906 --> 01:10:53.047
I'll put my bets on Cobo

01:10:55.528 --> 01:10:57.169
If she loses, she'll pay for it

01:10:57.649 --> 01:11:00.229
What are you gonna do to her?

01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:08.891
I wonder if they're picking a spot to start, and then...

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:11.312
Maybe when they enter the middle?

01:11:13.392 --> 01:11:14.953
Like, at the same time, maybe?

01:11:14.973 --> 01:11:19.774
Ooh, reverb

01:11:19.834 --> 01:11:21.334
Everyone's saying baby fella

01:11:25.509 --> 01:11:28.651
Okay, so you can only punch in the middle, I guess.

01:11:32.293 --> 01:11:33.534
I'd be too scared.

01:11:33.694 --> 01:11:38.717
Oh god! Wait, really? In the middle? This one?

01:11:39.018 --> 01:11:40.739
Is somebody setting up traps?

01:11:40.839 --> 01:11:42.520
Oh no, I think those are just there.

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:45.362
Wait, you can use armors and stuff?

01:11:45.862 --> 01:11:48.264
Anyways, let's check out everyone's videos

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:49.445
My face died, but that's okay

01:11:56.736 --> 01:11:59.197
Hahaha! It's so good for me!

01:11:59.217 --> 01:12:01.158
It's fine! I'm excited! I'm so excited!

01:12:01.238 --> 01:12:03.219
Hahaha!

01:12:04.499 --> 01:12:05.380
Oh no!

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.361
What? What? What's wrong with it?

01:12:08.581 --> 01:12:11.442
Oh no! Oh, do you wanna try using...

01:12:12.002 --> 01:12:14.023
Be in my body for one second.

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:15.924
What? Oh, you're like at 76%.

01:12:16.364 --> 01:12:17.345
Yeah, yeah. I'll steal it.

01:12:17.505 --> 01:12:17.745
Okay.

01:12:18.245 --> 01:12:20.326
Actually, I don't think it's gonna go that far.

01:12:20.626 --> 01:12:21.786
Uh-huh.

01:12:21.846 --> 01:12:22.507
Okay, I guess it will.

01:12:25.568 --> 01:12:26.168
Am I going to be you?

01:12:27.730 --> 01:12:28.210
If you have to...

01:12:29.291 --> 01:12:30.212
Oh yeah, do you want to be me?

01:12:30.272 --> 01:12:36.436
What do you want to say? Don't you have a...

01:12:36.897 --> 01:12:39.439
Hey everyone, I'm a secret agent!

01:12:39.479 --> 01:12:39.659
No!

01:12:40.419 --> 01:12:40.860
I just say...

01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:43.201
Oh, can you say...

01:12:43.922 --> 01:12:49.426
Cute. Cute. Cute.

01:12:49.526 --> 01:12:51.808
Okay, I'm back.

01:12:53.029 --> 01:12:53.549
I'll be back.

01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:54.770
I'm here. I'm just...

01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:58.952
Charging. Oh, Senpai's taken out.

01:12:59.272 --> 01:13:00.932
Oh no.

01:13:00.972 --> 01:13:03.893
This is a very quick game. This is gonna be a quick round.

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:04.033
Yeah.

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.773
Let's see if we can find anybody that's alive.

01:13:05.853 --> 01:13:07.594
Oh, Anya, just taken out.

01:13:09.194 --> 01:13:10.374
Bey, taken out already.

01:13:10.394 --> 01:13:12.694
Everyone's out.

01:13:12.934 --> 01:13:13.795
Who's still alive?

01:13:14.375 --> 01:13:16.675
Oh, Nobuko Senpai's still alive. Let's go.

01:13:18.255 --> 01:13:21.896
Winner!

01:13:23.436 --> 01:13:24.256
Take a dinner!

01:13:25.217 --> 01:13:26.437
Winner winner chicken dinner

01:13:26.737 --> 01:13:26.857
Ah!

01:13:27.857 --> 01:13:28.397
She won?

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:29.978
Okay, yeah

01:13:30.158 --> 01:13:31.218
Nice!

01:13:31.238 --> 01:13:33.139
First match, first round winner

01:13:33.779 --> 01:13:34.639
We lost our bet

01:13:34.859 --> 01:13:35.419
Yeah

01:13:35.959 --> 01:13:38.000
I should've picked it all the closer by

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.100
She's... She plays a lot of Apex

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:44.481
So cute, the wallpaper's so cute

01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:45.541
You're all over

01:13:46.242 --> 01:13:50.903
I got this really cute art that somebody did of like small ame and big ame

01:13:50.943 --> 01:13:51.743
like down in the field.

01:13:52.384 --> 01:13:54.185
Yame, so cute

01:13:54.205 --> 01:13:55.326
Bobo-Kosenpai, sayo!

01:13:55.346 --> 01:13:55.546
Sayo!

01:13:55.567 --> 01:13:56.327
Did you say your name?

01:13:57.168 --> 01:13:57.388
More?

01:14:15.385 --> 01:14:16.385
I thought she said your name

01:14:16.405 --> 01:14:19.007
I thought she said my name too

01:14:19.887 --> 01:14:20.728
Maybe she heard you

01:14:21.128 --> 01:14:22.649
Nope, I don't think so

01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:25.951
That scared me

01:14:26.952 --> 01:14:28.613
That scared me, I was like...

01:14:28.773 --> 01:14:29.794
I'll pick it up

01:14:31.114 --> 01:14:33.036
I'll pick it up

01:14:33.056 --> 01:14:35.197
I'll pick it up

01:14:35.677 --> 01:14:36.658
I'll pick it up

01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:38.659
I'll pick it up

01:14:38.739 --> 01:14:41.421
I'll pick it up

01:14:41.581 --> 01:14:43.682
Congrats to Zetta, I did nothing!

01:14:44.884 --> 01:14:46.425
I did nothing

01:14:46.465 --> 01:14:47.985
She heard you

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:49.326
She connected

01:14:49.406 --> 01:14:51.267
She heard me through the screen

01:14:51.427 --> 01:14:52.227
Oh no

01:14:54.148 --> 01:14:55.389
My face is loaded in

01:14:55.929 --> 01:14:56.349
Almost

01:14:56.989 --> 01:15:01.111
Excuse me, sorry

01:15:01.431 --> 01:15:03.712
No, you have to apologize

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:06.593
It sounds so gross sometimes

01:15:06.673 --> 01:15:07.834
No, it's not

01:15:08.014 --> 01:15:10.115
I don't know, it sounds cute.

01:15:14.257 --> 01:15:15.558
Oh, 2nd round? 2nd round?

01:15:16.138 --> 01:15:17.118
Yeah, 2nd round

01:15:20.079 --> 01:15:21.219
Ame is dying

01:15:22.079 --> 01:15:24.020
No, like, how do I say this?

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.642
No normal human being would be able to withstand the power of this bow

01:15:30.862 --> 01:15:32.522
Oh, I see, I see

01:15:32.762 --> 01:15:37.044
Maybe that's why I died for a little bit, sucked all my energy

01:15:37.064 --> 01:15:38.624
Yeah, all your life energy

01:15:41.565 --> 01:15:43.105
I'm stuck now. I can't take it off.

01:15:43.626 --> 01:15:46.587
We can't take it off. Never, never, never

01:15:46.607 --> 01:15:52.350
Yeah, but you know, actually I decided to borrow these so that we could match

01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:55.592
Like I was thinking maybe you could wear the hat that I gave you, remember?

01:15:55.612 --> 01:15:58.573
And then we could like switch off or something

01:15:58.633 --> 01:16:01.074
But I didn't have the file for your hat

01:16:01.094 --> 01:16:02.735
Me too, me too, I don't have the file

01:16:02.795 --> 01:16:04.896
Next time, next time

01:16:04.936 --> 01:16:05.776
Next time

01:16:06.376 --> 01:16:07.457
Wear our matching hats.

01:16:12.444 --> 01:16:20.186
I wear, I wear your um what is it I wear I think the last time I wore your hat was like

01:16:20.206 --> 01:16:24.187
I don't remember. I I wore it a few more times after the bird

01:16:24.207 --> 01:16:27.107
It should be yeah, I saw I saw

01:16:27.127 --> 01:16:32.549
It looks good

01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:35.129
I see us the hat that I took off over there

01:16:39.483 --> 01:16:42.644
All right, we're going into the last round, and then...

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:46.806
Uh, we'll see who the next winner is...

01:16:50.748 --> 01:16:51.308
Who is it?

01:16:51.508 --> 01:16:54.609
What if it's Roboco-senpai again for the second time?

01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:54.870
Hmm...

01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:56.750
Maybe she got lucky though.

01:16:56.890 --> 01:16:58.771
I mean, I'm sure there's some skill involved, but...

01:16:59.572 --> 01:17:01.212
Kind of like positioning...

01:17:02.093 --> 01:17:03.493
I'm waiting people out

01:17:08.783 --> 01:17:11.825
Not really, because yeah, everybody goes in that hole.

01:17:11.845 --> 01:17:16.468
Hole.

01:17:18.209 --> 01:17:21.351
I think they have time to look for shields or something.

01:17:21.371 --> 01:17:24.553
Because I saw some people had like blue shields or purple shields.

01:17:24.993 --> 01:17:26.194
Oh yeah, that makes sense.

01:17:27.535 --> 01:17:28.875
But it depends on where you land.

01:17:29.956 --> 01:17:30.776
And what you loot.

01:17:31.237 --> 01:17:31.617
Yeah.

01:17:32.517 --> 01:17:33.058
Loot quick!

01:17:34.038 --> 01:17:35.559
I guess they're doing King's Canyon.

01:17:35.579 --> 01:17:39.201
I'm trying to think of what part of the map would be good for like...

01:17:40.103 --> 01:17:41.343
A free-for-all sort of...

01:17:41.363 --> 01:17:43.204
Area

01:17:43.964 --> 01:17:45.845
I don't know what this is

01:17:45.865 --> 01:17:46.805
Yeah, it is king's king

01:17:46.825 --> 01:17:48.025
Maybe it's like on top of the...

01:17:48.085 --> 01:17:49.626
You know the skeleton?

01:17:49.646 --> 01:17:50.546
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:17:50.586 --> 01:17:51.406
Like the ribs?

01:17:51.486 --> 01:17:52.987
That'd be kinda cool

01:17:53.007 --> 01:17:54.167
If you fall...

01:17:54.187 --> 01:17:55.628
Oh no, I was gonna say if you fall, you die

01:17:55.648 --> 01:17:56.868
But I forgot there's no fall damage

01:17:56.888 --> 01:17:59.669
You can just die

01:17:59.809 --> 01:18:01.129
I feel like they wouldn't shoot

01:18:01.809 --> 01:18:04.770
It'd be kinda fun if there was like a...

01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:07.491
A game mode where everybody's like on a plank

01:18:07.551 --> 01:18:08.511
And like you could fall off

01:18:08.691 --> 01:18:08.952
you're like

01:18:09.512 --> 01:18:11.553
Punch people off or something

01:18:11.653 --> 01:18:13.554
It's like a boxing ring but without the ring

01:18:13.734 --> 01:18:14.594
Yeah, yeah

01:18:14.654 --> 01:18:17.795
Like up in the sky and then you just fall off the map if you get hit off

01:18:17.995 --> 01:18:19.495
Oh, that's so cool

01:18:19.515 --> 01:18:21.176
They call it like sumo wrestling

01:18:32.219 --> 01:18:32.919
Stretching!

01:18:32.939 --> 01:18:34.780
After you crack your bag.

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:35.860
Ugh.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:36.280
Ooh.

01:18:37.181 --> 01:18:37.441
Yay!

01:18:39.782 --> 01:18:40.002
Uh...

01:18:40.362 --> 01:18:42.503
Gotta stretch, stretch

01:18:43.563 --> 01:18:46.104
So what cool things have you done here in Japan that you're...

01:18:46.264 --> 01:18:47.585
You're okay to talk about?

01:18:48.885 --> 01:18:49.045
Oh...

01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:50.626
I might...I might...

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:51.826
I'll tell you later

01:18:51.946 --> 01:18:52.627
Okay, okay, okay

01:18:52.787 --> 01:18:53.507
We'll talk about it later

01:18:53.627 --> 01:18:54.527
We'll talk about it later

01:18:54.667 --> 01:18:55.127
I'll tell you

01:18:55.248 --> 01:18:55.828
All the stories

01:18:56.028 --> 01:18:56.648
Yay!

01:18:57.728 --> 01:19:00.829
Exclusive secret detective agent stuff

01:19:00.849 --> 01:19:03.110
Secret agent stuff

01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:05.231
Yeah

01:19:05.291 --> 01:19:07.932
non-detectives would not be able to know

01:19:09.034 --> 01:19:10.335
Ooh, I wonder if they're gonna fight...

01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:12.017
Wait, everybody's like in different parts of the map

01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:15.380
Oh, is this a regular game mode?

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:18.443
Because people are getting guns and stuff

01:19:20.245 --> 01:19:22.328
Wait, what?

01:19:22.648 --> 01:19:24.009
Why? What game mode is this?

01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:25.191
This is not...

01:19:25.791 --> 01:19:26.672
It looks like a regular...

01:19:26.692 --> 01:19:27.093
Battle Royale

01:19:31.178 --> 01:19:34.480
Is it duos? Oh, it's still hide-and-seek. Okay, hide-and-seek, I see, I see.

01:19:36.541 --> 01:19:40.663
Oh, I thought it would, like, go for two rounds. Yeah, maybe it's just one.

01:19:42.183 --> 01:19:43.424
Maybe they ran out of time.

01:19:46.806 --> 01:19:47.126
So...

01:19:47.846 --> 01:19:49.467
Bey is the seeker.

01:19:49.767 --> 01:19:51.408
Bey is seeker.

01:19:51.768 --> 01:19:51.928
And...

01:19:51.948 --> 01:19:53.589
Uh, I'm not sure who else that is.

01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:58.171
Amiya's hiding.

01:19:58.191 --> 01:19:58.931
Melted by Tybee!

01:20:02.054 --> 01:20:02.654
Ookie Zorig

01:20:04.976 --> 01:20:05.256
Echii

01:20:06.577 --> 01:20:07.097
Echii

01:20:07.157 --> 01:20:08.418
Oh no!

01:20:09.799 --> 01:20:11.240
I love her gun

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.800
I love her gun! Like she's just...

01:20:14.001 --> 01:20:14.682
Hey, cute!

01:20:15.882 --> 01:20:18.324
I love how she's just doing snail and I like that

01:20:18.924 --> 01:20:19.544
She's so cute

01:20:19.605 --> 01:20:21.226
I like how she's holding her glock

01:20:22.706 --> 01:20:24.367
Yofie, Sairi

01:20:25.228 --> 01:20:26.269
Zuri, Sairi

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:28.390
Oh, Sairi

01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:29.510
Yup, her

01:20:30.291 --> 01:20:31.271
Go on, as a seeker.

01:20:35.179 --> 01:20:36.479
Oh, watch the secret P.O.B.

01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:38.781
Oh, this will be fun!

01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:43.143
Toa Senpai's P.O.B. will be fun, we'll see.

01:20:43.163 --> 01:20:45.084
Kind of for... Oh, there it goes.

01:20:46.084 --> 01:20:46.905
It's loading, it's loading.

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:47.685
It's loading, it's loading!

01:20:47.965 --> 01:20:49.506
Don't worry, chat. It's loading!

01:20:49.826 --> 01:20:50.366
It's loading!

01:20:53.468 --> 01:20:54.208
Oh my god.

01:20:54.748 --> 01:20:57.610
They're the cute indies.

01:20:58.070 --> 01:21:00.311
Yeah, they're so cute.

01:21:03.172 --> 01:21:04.153
The lag is real.

01:21:04.734 --> 01:21:05.575
It's the pink!

01:21:05.795 --> 01:21:07.116
It's the pink!

01:21:08.117 --> 01:21:08.778
It's the pink!

01:21:08.938 --> 01:21:10.279
Definitely not us!

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:11.320
Somebody just...

01:21:11.821 --> 01:21:12.841
I think somebody just fell!

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:14.923
They were trying to hide!

01:21:14.943 --> 01:21:15.123
Oh no!

01:21:15.584 --> 01:21:16.605
Oh no!

01:21:16.625 --> 01:21:19.027
I think they have to restart

01:21:26.333 --> 01:21:29.134
I'm imagining being Ollie and just like flicking and spectating

01:21:29.714 --> 01:21:33.535
Oh sorry sorry sorry you gotta restart

01:21:33.975 --> 01:21:35.595
And was it Anya? Anya?

01:21:36.015 --> 01:21:36.936
Oh no

01:21:39.216 --> 01:21:40.797
This is a very ambitious spot

01:21:42.357 --> 01:21:42.957
Sad

01:21:43.277 --> 01:21:44.497
Fell over the edge

01:21:45.778 --> 01:21:51.619
it's okay it's okay we all fall sometimes but the thing is do we get up

01:21:53.461 --> 01:21:55.302
I'm surprised, like, just starting the whole match

01:21:55.623 --> 01:21:56.623
Because of someone died

01:21:56.643 --> 01:21:57.944
Someone dying

01:21:58.144 --> 01:21:58.805
I guess that makes sense

01:22:00.326 --> 01:22:01.287
But do we need...

01:22:01.327 --> 01:22:02.668
Oh, I guess we have to

01:22:03.689 --> 01:22:04.029
Okay, 1, 2, 3

01:22:05.230 --> 01:22:05.990
Yeah, I'm...

01:22:06.751 --> 01:22:08.132
Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

01:22:11.915 --> 01:22:14.357
She's counting, she's counting

01:22:14.697 --> 01:22:15.077
Okay

01:22:16.318 --> 01:22:16.678
Yum!

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:20.381
What the hell?

01:22:23.225 --> 01:22:23.345
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, okay 1, 2

01:22:23.585 --> 01:22:25.266
1, 2, 1, 2 I think they might be running low on time

01:22:25.286 --> 01:22:26.187
Because I think the next...

01:22:26.207 --> 01:22:26.828
They're doing the mix...

01:22:26.848 --> 01:22:27.528
Uhm, tournament...

01:22:27.548 --> 01:22:28.329
In a little bit

01:22:28.349 --> 01:22:33.713
Like, 15-ish minutes I think is when they're supposed to start theirs, so...

01:22:49.867 --> 01:22:51.848
I guess this is the last one?

01:22:52.508 --> 01:22:55.170
I guess so. Is this the last one, chat?

01:22:56.130 --> 01:22:58.231
The chat is like the actual...

01:22:58.551 --> 01:22:59.272
The actual...

01:23:00.012 --> 01:23:01.553
Reactors...

01:23:01.593 --> 01:23:03.614
We're reactors. They're the ones, you know...

01:23:03.714 --> 01:23:05.835
Giving us the contact, the information.

01:23:05.875 --> 01:23:08.796
Yeah, the information. That's right.

01:23:08.816 --> 01:23:10.077
Yes. No, maybe yes.

01:23:10.757 --> 01:23:11.798
Oh, okay. Wow.

01:23:11.838 --> 01:23:12.398
It's mixed.

01:23:12.658 --> 01:23:14.499
It's mixed.

01:23:15.139 --> 01:23:17.220
uh staff chat staff

01:23:20.109 --> 01:23:21.950
I see you, it might be delayed, right?

01:23:22.671 --> 01:23:23.551
Oh, she might push...

01:23:25.792 --> 01:23:27.653
Unfortunately, we will not be commentating...

01:23:27.713 --> 01:23:30.294
This is a Zazu, let's be honest, no!

01:23:30.374 --> 01:23:32.435
Well, no, no, no, no, no!

01:23:32.475 --> 01:23:36.817
We're providing food content, reaction content...

01:23:37.657 --> 01:23:39.398
Zazu content...

01:23:39.738 --> 01:23:40.779
We're watching a game!

01:23:41.159 --> 01:23:42.779
Yeah, gaming content...

01:23:42.799 --> 01:23:44.180
This is gaming content!

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:44.760
Yeah, yeah.

01:23:45.401 --> 01:23:48.142
